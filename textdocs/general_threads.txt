Tema 1: Promos/Expansions for Azul Mini
Pregunta:
Anyone found a way to make the expansions /promos compatible for Azul Mini?
1. Azul: Crystal Mosaic
2. Azul: Special Factories
3. Azul: Joker Tiles

Respuesta 1:
1 and 2 you probably can take pictures and print them off to the mini size. 3 you probably can find some kind of thick clear plastic and make your own tiles.

Respuesta 3:
What I ended up doing was painting over the existing factories, though I did this after laminating them and they've been fading over time due to repeated use. If I painted and then laminated them, then I would probably get way more use out of them. For the x2 tokens included in Azul: Special Factories , I just took some foamy and cut some small squares to serve that purpose. If I remember, I will take some photos later and show them. One thing to note is that given they're double-sided, you can use the other side as normal and what I like doing is just tossing them like a coin, and see which factory we play each game with. We don't reset the factories each round because it's a hassle to take them out of the plastic container.



Tema 2: States of different versions
Pregunta:
Recently, I've sold the first version of this wonderful game and I've just bought the mini version not long ago. Amazing so far (in terms of saving space), but the question is...

How could I keep the first one in "previously owned" state and the one in "owned" state at the same time? I can't do it because they're considered the same game (and I'm aware of it, but I need to fix my "concern").

I know it's a foolish affair, but I'm so organized when talking about board games...

Thanks in advance,

Miguel.

You can add a second copy of the same game to your collection. Go to the game page, click on 'my games' and then click the 'add another copy' button.

Tema 3: Publisher, please read (solo viability)
Pregunta:
Dear publisher,

I don’t normally do this with my unofficial solo Automas but the one I created for Azul still continues to be requested. It has over 3,500 downloads and I receive 3-4 requests per week for an alternate art version via GeekMail and email requests. There is an opportunity here to bring Azul to more solo gamers. I would love to work with you to bring this to the public in an official way.

My solo Automa for Azul gives a player an opponent, named Emma, to compete against. It is very easy to run and provides replayability along with a nice challenge with various difficulties.

Tema 4: Question about pattern lines and being forced to take tiles
Pregunta:
If all my pattern lines are occupied but there are still tiles on the factory displays/center display, do I have to pick them and throw them to the floor? or can I pass?

Respuesta 1:
You always have to take tiles. No passing allowed.

Respuesta 2:
As a followup, you can always choose not to place the tiles that you take, even if you have space for them. These still end up on the floor as negative points, but could really help in turn order or even more negative points in the future.



Tema 5: Alternate Tile Sets - Availability?
Pregunta:
Anyone know the best way to get official alternate tile sets for Azul? I’m trying to locate sets 3, 4, 5, and 6. Are there any concerns about counterfeit copies of those sets since they were more of a niche product?

Tema 6: Rounds and phases
Pregunta:
I am really pissed at the rulebook: the explanation of rounds and phases is cryptic and you would never understand that the 1st phase ends when all the tiles are picked up. The rulebook (at least in Azul mini) confuses rounds and phases a lot.

Respuesta 1:
I don’t have the mini rule book, but the stock rule book is pretty clear about when the factory phase ends.

“This phase ends when the center of the table and all factory displays contain no more tiles”

Tema 8: Too luck-based for me
Pregunta:
This game is a weird one. It at first feels like it's really suited for players who want to have a duel of wits; a very tactical game where the best player wins.

But unfortunately the more I play it the more I realise that past the point where there's a significant skill gap between players luck is the major deciding factor in most matches.

I just had a very disappointing match where I was behind the whole game, having made some bad moves at first and my opponent having blocked me quite well, only to get a crazy favourable draw in the last round where no matter what we did I was going to get all I needed to complete my combos and my opponent wouldn't. I ended up winning by a small margin, but it felt really cheap.

Don't get me wrong, it's a great game, but not really for competitive play. At least not for me.

That sounds disappointing, indeed. For you, anyway. It sounds like both you and your opponent have a good grasp of tactics. Yours just kicked in a little too late.

@btonasse
…only to get a crazy favourable draw in the last round where no matter what we did I was going to get all I needed to complete my combos and my opponent wouldn't. I ended up winning by a small margin, but it felt really cheap.
"Small margin..." Doesn't sound like luck was a "major deciding factor." It does, however, sound like one "very disappointing match." I've had those in chess games.

Respuesta 2:
Pretty much all board and card games have some luck… the key is how much of the result depends on luck vs skill.

I only recently got into Azul, so it is still relatively new to me, but I enjoy the random draw and trying to work out how to adapt. If I won every game because I was better than my opponent, I would get bored of the game pretty quickly.

You could still have it be competitive by playing multiple games, to balance out the luck factor.

How often would you say you lose like this due to luck?

Respuesta 3:
There is a lot more going on in Azul than meets the eye.


A couple or examples -

- Good players will know at the start of round 4 approximately (or even precisely) how many of each colour are left in the bag, which will change what they will select for rows 4/5 in the last two rounds.

- Knowing your and your opponents approximate score and potential score on the fly comes into play, so you know wether ending the game is a good or bad idea on round 5.

- Avoiding the corners is advisable in most circumstances in the first 3 rounds due to limiting score potential, but knowing when and which to claim to allow for 5 of a kind is vital for end game scoring.

The more you play, the more depth you "unlock".

Our average score over the first 30 games: 73.25
Our average score over our most recent 30 games: 87.67

Respuesta 4:
This is not the case. You need to play more to see the tactics in play. I was lucky enough to have a 80% win rate over a good number of games on BGA.



Tema 9: Spare part - one red tile lost
Pregunta:
Hi, we had christmas party in our house and wanted to introduce Azul to family...several children, few dogs, 3 generations etc....and in all mess one red tile was missing in the end. We bought game in 2017, i dont have any certificate that i bought it, so i cannot fill in missing parts formular. Also as i understand, asmodee has policy to not send spare parts if i lost them. Is there any chance to get one red tile in some other way? I own many games, and didnt miss any parts until now, i really have OCD when it comes to games, so this is completly new teritorry for me. Any suggestions, for help?

P.s. i searched whole room several times, and suspect that one of dogs has eaten it.
P.p.s. i am not sure is this dog part joke or not.

All best for Christman and holidays, thx in advance,
Mladen

Respuesta 1:
1) There are some promo times that you could replace all the reds.
2) Once a red tile gets used, instead of putting back in the box, just put one in the bag.
3) Buy a used copy of Azul and have extra tiles.

A couple suggestions:

1) Replace your tiles with Starburst candies and reward the winner of each game with a candy "tile" of their choice that they can eat. That way, any lost, or eaten, tiles are easily replaceable. (Hopefully you have Starburst in your country).


2) Post in the BGG Spare Parts Geeklist to see if anyone has a spare red tile over there.

Tema 10: 2 games that are thematically connected that can played in a row : Vidrado and Azul
Pregunta:
I would say that we can play two different type of games games in a row that are very thematically connected. I am talking about the amazing Vidrado (from the designer Joao Quintela Martins) and Azul. The first one is a amazing economic small box game where we produce the ceramic pieces "azulejos" in a factory. The second one, the well known Azul, is the funny continuation of the first one putting the pieces on a wall. And by the way the box of azul mini is nice to store the Vidrado sleeved.

What do you think?



Tema 11: Taste the Blue – A Concise Guide to All Flavors Azul (...so Far!)
Pregunta:
Azul is a series of delightfully colorful abstract games praised for their brisk gameplay and marvelous production. Each installment is designed around the refreshing trademark drafting mechanism, but also comes with slight twists in the surrounding mechanics, giving each a unique flair. Feel free to sit down for a nuanced rundown before enjoying your time at the gaming table with the cocktail of your choice.

Strawberry Azure
Azul, the original. An enduring classic that captured the heart of amateurs and connoisseurs alike. The vanilla variety is spicily straightforward: Every round of drafting comes with a juicy scoring finish, with the notoriously easy-to-achieve option to bitter the opponent’s scoring gulp with a hefty penalty. It is also easier to parse who’s leading the race than in the sequels, making hate-drafting that more palatable. A weathered gamer might prefer the twistier latter installments, but the vanilla hardly ever disappoints. Nor does the chocolate version, if that’s your cup of cocoa. It’s a neat welcome drink for boardgame beginners that goes down in less than an hour; spicy yet elegant to fill in with dignity, too.

Lavender Indigo
Question not the sequel, for you might just acquire the taste for its ghostly qualities. The Stained Glass of Sintra faces the curse of the second installment surprisingly, eschewing the solid resin for translucent glass-like plastic and providing the players with a modular board that changes with every session. It plays like a gamer-oriented alternative of the original, introducing more strategy while still keeping the fast-paced tactical heartbeat of the original. A little longer per session, yes, but the refinements do benefit the brave owner of this underrated version.

Lime Cyan 
Fresh like popping a mint in the summer breeze. The Summer Pavilion is the most relaxed sequel. There’s plenty of space, plenty of time to organize the plethora of lozenges into colorful stars. With the third installment, the Azul series crosses over to a more strategic experience. Don’t be fooled, there’s still the sour taste of taking penalties for an untimely pickup of spiked tiles. But it is more manageable than in the predecessors. This version is here for the players who want to lay back a little and stargaze at the kaleidoscopic display of its resin tiles. Just don't get starstruck: The tension can surprise you in the final round out of nowhere!

Lemongrass Blue 
Much like a true royalty, the fourth installment brings Azul into territories previously uncharted. The Queen’s Garden is by far the most puzzling and involved of the sequels. The convoluted contraption of its rules is best suited for engaged gamers. Those who take the time to study this variant’s intricacies will be rewarded with a strategic experience unparalleled in the Azul domain. The interaction between players lays hidden in the labyrinth of the Garden’s unusual drafting, raising the tension from behind the curtains. The intrigue comes to fruition during a gameplay that is definitely lengthier and crunchier than that of its ancestors, but well worth the investment.

Honeydew Navy 
Coming soon, a continuation of the saga. Stay tuned for a brief review of the upcoming celestial experience. For lovers only!

Tema 12: Are you allowed to swap tiles after they are placed
Pregunta:
I had this conversation with my partner, and the rules are unclear about this specific aspect. I am fairly sure that the answer to this question is that, no, you cannot swap tiles in the tile drafting phase, however they believe that you can.

Let me illustrate what I am talking about for you:

here is the tile board - "_" is any empty space in your tile drafting wall, lets say that "x" is a red tile, and "o" is a blue tile.
x
x x
_ _ _
_ _ _ _
_ _ _ _ _

Lets say you draft 2 blue tiles on one round. They believe that it is alright to move the two red tiles present in the second row down, and place the blue tiles in their place as follows:

x
o o
x x _
_ _ _ _
_ _ _ _ _

Nowhere is this swapping mentioned in the rules, I believe it undermines the strategy of the game, and the capability of peaking at other's boards. I tried to search this online with no luck. If any of you could provide insight, I would much appreciate it.

Respuesta 1:
Swapping is forbidden.

Respuesta 2:
If it was allowed, it would have needed to be explicitly stated.

About placement:
...add the tiles you picked to one of the 5 pattern lines on
your player board.
* Place the tiles, one by one, from right to left in your chosen pattern line.
* If the pattern line already holds tiles, you may only add tiles of the same color to it.
* Once all spaces of a pattern line are
filled, that line is considered complete. If you have picked up
more tiles than you can place in your chosen pattern line, you must place the excess tiles in the floor line...

Nowhere does it explain how one should move a line. It would need to explain what to do for a movement up as well as down.

Respuesta 3:
It doesn't say in the rules that I can't run around the table 6 times drop my trousers and whistle dixie before each turn.
It doesn't say in the rules that I can 'release the hounds' if I'm losing.
It doesn't say in the rules...

1. That's just plain silly
2. Point made.

Respuesta 4:
Edgar Wilde
@EdgarWilde
.... If you have picked up more tiles than you can place in your chosen pattern line, you must place the excess tiles in the floor line...
This effectively kills the idea of moving tiles to another line. (Otherwise the rules would have mentioned moving tiles for accommodating more tiles of the same colour.)

Respuesta 5:
Edgar Wilde
@EdgarWilde
If it was allowed, it would have needed to be explicitly stated.
And kill the game

Respuesta 6:
The rules clearly state:
Quote:
If the pattern line already holds tiles, you may only add tiles of the same colour to it
(My emphasis)
So you may add tiles of the same colour if they fit. You may NOT add more tiles than will fit. You may NOT add tiles of a different colour. You may NOT move the tiles already there and then add tiles of a different colour

Also consider
Quote:
Then add the tiles you picked to one of the five pattern lines
and also
Quote:
Once all the spaces of a pattern line are filled, that line is considered complete. If you have picked up more tiles than you can place on your chosen line, you must place the excess tiles on the floor line
Note that it doesn't say you can move them to a longer line.

All quotes from the first printing rule book. The one with the cardboard 1st player token.

Respuesta 7:
The rules example also has the player picking up a yellow tile and showing that it can't be placed in specific rows because there are already yellow tiles in the 'pattern' area. It goes on to say that the tile can't be placed in row 4 because there is already a blue tile there and therefore the yellow must be played elsewhere, or not played at all.

It doesn't include an option to move the blue tile so that the yellow can be put in line 4. It says the yellow CANNOT be placed in row 4 because there is already a blue tile there. The rules definitely seem to imply that you can't move it, but the example clearly demontrates that is the correct interpretation.



Tema 13: Azul: Duel is coming
Pregunta:
So far, we only have this picture (and the small disappointment, that it wasn't called "Azuel" ).
Source is a Facebook post from "Ludi Toy'z", a French board game shop.
Looks different enough from the others, so I'm curious.

Respuesta 1:
I don't know what demand this Azul Duel would meet, since regular Azul with two people is already the best way to play.

I would understand if they made an "Azul Party" designed specifically for three or more players.

Tema 15: Is my copy of Azul counterfeit?
Pregunta:
I got a copy of Azul in June, and when I got it I noticed that the bag was printed in reverse, and I thought it was probably just a printing error and wasn't too bothered. Then I saw someone saying that the scoring cubes in Azul haven't been made of wood for many years, and my ones are made of wood. I then checked on Amazon, and it turns out the seller wasn't Amazon, but some seller with an address in China and no current products for sale, which made me even more suspicious. I've only got like 3 or 4 days left to put in an A-Z guarantee claim, so I'm just posting here to see if people think it's fake or not. To be honest, it's mostly a fairly good fake, if it is.

Respuesta 1:
I compared this to my copy I bought at Target with a date of 2018. Mine did have the wooden cubes back then, but I've heard they moved to plastic. Mine is a Next Move games version.

1) The bag has reversed print
2) The printing on the tiles is about 10% too small
3) Where's the 1st player tile?
4) The insert is close. Mine does not have the little divots on the outside edge.

My guess is that you have a counterfit (albeit a pretty good one).

Respuesta 2:
From the photos, I can see the old Plan B logo on the box. Newer copies have the Next Move logo on it. That would make sense with the fact the cubes are stil in wood. My version - NM already - still has the wooden cubes.

Your copy seems to be legit. Old, but legit xD
How do the tiles feel? Weak plastic or nice and sturdy?

Edit: ok, with Ori's comment it looks like this copy is in fact a - very well produced - counterfeit copy

Tema 16: Azul: Embellece con azulejos el Palacio Real de Évora
Pregunta:
Azul es un juego donde tendrás que situar los azulejos siguiendo unos patrones de color y colocación. Emplea una estrategia que te haga ganar puntos y perder los menos posibles para ser el ganador de la partida.


¿CÓMO SE JUEGA?
Azul se desarrolla en tres fases:
A. Oferta de fábrica. Por turnos se irán seleccionando las losetas del mismo color y se colocarán en las líneas del patrón del tablero individual siguiendo las reglas o en la línea de suelo si no las has podido colocar.

B. Alicatado. De manera simultánea todos los jugadores pasarán las losetas de las líneas de patrón a las paredes (si están completas) y se puntuarán de manera vertical y horizontal si procede.

C. Preparación de la siguiente ronda.


El juego finaliza cuando un jugador en la fase de Alicatado ha logrado completar al menos 5 losetas en la pared de manera horizontal. Suma todos los puntos, incorpora los bonus y sé el jugador con más puntuación para lograr la victoria.


OPINIÓN
Este juego abstracto lleva a los jugadores a emplear la estrategia hasta el final, ya que cualquier acción de los otros jugadores y las losetas que van apareciendo influyen de manera directa en nuestras acciones. Azul es una combinación perfecta entre azar y estrategia durante toda la partida.

Tema 17: A 5 player variant for Azul
Pregunta:
Here is a way to have a 5 player version of Azul. It requires having both Azul and the Azul: Master Chocolatier games, or create your own sets of two more colors of tiles. I tested it with some friends, and it worked out great. In the version we played, we used all the tiles and factory displays from Master Chocolatier so we could also play the other side of the factory displays. You then need two sets of color tiles from the original game, two factory displays and one player board. You also must play using the back side of the player boards since you now have 7 colors instead of the 5 shown on the front side.
Note, I tested out a 6 player version by adding one more set of color tiles and two more factory displays. It worked OK, but there are fewer chances to get three or more tiles in a turn. But the 5 player variant is great!

Respuesta 1:
Getting a 6th color on its own sounds cool already. A small issue I can see popping up is that the Special Factories have just the Master Chocolatier colors, so at no point you get base game Azul tiles to move to other tiles.

Respuesta 2:
Thanks for replying Edgar! I added two more colors because at 4 players in the basic game, the number of tiles and the number of spaces on the player boards exactly match. If you add just one more color in a 5 player game, there would be fewer tiles available than spaces on player boards.

True, the two colors from the base game will never get 'picked' for special moves. But I did not see that as much of a loss. If desired, one could make boards to match the base colors by printing out my sheet for adding the Special Factories to the original Azul game.

But yeah, if someone needs to spice it up for themselves, you can purchase them. Here are the blue ones - https://boardgamecafe.biz/products/2409-azul-collectors-teal...

Azul is an abstract tile-drafting game in which players attempt to build the best mosaic by filling in player boards with tiles of different colors in order to score points based on how/when the tiles are placed.


What we liked:
-Turns are very quick. On your turn, you simply choose tiles of one color from one of the available factories, or from the center of the table. Any remaining tiles on the factory then get moved to the middle of the table. You then must put your tiles onto your player board in an available row, and each row can only contain tiles of one color. Rows are also varying lengths, and any excess tiles will move to the bottom of a player’s board and accrue negative points.
-Satisfying scoring. At the end of the round, for any completed row, players will move the right-most tile to the space of its corresponding color on the mosaic section of their board, and will score points based on the number of connected tiles in its row and column. As the game progresses, this can lead to some high-scoring moves when you place a tile just right so that it scores a lot of points for adjacency.
-Beautiful components. Most of the component quality is positive. The tiles are beautiful in color, and have a satisfying tactile feel to mix in the draw bag (which has the Azul logo printed on its side). This is a huge positive since most of the game involves handling these tiles. We also loved how there is a dedicated starting player tile, which makes it easy to track the starting player for each round.
-Cut-throat nature at 2p. This could be a positive or negative depending on your viewpoint, but this game certainly has the ability to be mean. For example, just by looking at the other player’s board, it’s easy to grab a pile of tiles you know they will need and will leave them unable to complete a row by the end of the round. You could also force a player to have to pick up a LOT of tiles of one color where they have nowhere to put it, and must then lose a lot of points at the end of the round.
-Double-sided board offers game variability. We enjoyed the fact that there is a side that has colors pre-printed on the mosaic, as well as a blank side if you’d like the added challenge of filling in a board with the limitation of each row and column only containing 1 tile of each color.


Neutral:
-The scoring can be a little bit difficult for new players to understand, especially those with little experience with board games. Because the game is so quick, however, it's easy for players to grasp how rows fill and scoring after just a couple rounds.


Negative:
-The player boards themselves are a little finicky. Because the boards are not dual-layered, they are prone to pieces getting knocked around. For the tiles, this is only a minor inconvenience. However, for the cube on the player board score track, this can lead to being unsure what your score was and having to use your best guess.

Final thoughts:
We fell in love with Azul in terms of its quick gameplay, interesting decisions, game arc, and (fun) cut-throat nature at the 2 player count. This is a game we have continued to play many times whenever we have a chance to play a short game and want something that will be quick to set up. This feels like a game we will keep playing for many years to come!

Did we keep it to play or trade it away?
We decided to keep it to play!

Tema 20: AZUL – iliti plavo na portugalskom/španjolskom (Recenzija)
Pregunta:
Evo mene opet ali barem nije opet recenzija od Brune Cathale. Ovaj put se radi o Azulu i polovici jako poznatog dizajnerskog dvojca Kramer & Kiesling – u ovom slučaju Michaelu Kieslingu.

Azul je igra za 2 – 4 igrača (meni najbolja u 2 igrača) i iako je deklarirana na nekih 30 do 45 minuta, traje otprilike 20 minuta kad se ufurate.

Tema ovo igre je skoro pa nepostojeća ali ideja je da su igrači umjetnici koji trebaju ukrasiti palaču u Portugalu, jer se kralj Manuel Prvi, u posjetu Alhambri u Andaluziji raspametio azulejosima, lijepim bijelo plavim pločicama te je naredio svojim umjetnicima da u tom stilu još ljepše ukrase njegovu palaču. Upravo su te pločice ono što produkcijski podiže inače apstraktnu igru jer iako od teške plastike, fakat izgledaju kao pločice za zid.

Azul se igra tako da se iz vrećice u kojoj se nalaze pločice, nasumično vade 4 pločice na krugove (koji predstavljaju manufakture). Broj manufaktura ovisi o broju igrača dva igrača igraju s pt manufaktura, tri sa sedam, a kad igra četiri igrača koristi se svih devet manufaktura. Uz to svi igrači imaju svoju ploču (iliti zidić) za slaganje odabranih pločica.

I to je cijelo postavljanje igre a prvi igrač je onaj koji je zadnji posjetio Portugal ili se bira nasumično.

Po redu igranja, igrači uzimaju pločice s manufaktura (i to sve pločice jedne boje). Ako je nešto ostalo na manufakturi, taj ostatak ide na centralno mjesto s kojeg se isto mogu uzimati pločice, prema istom principu). I ovdje igrači uzimaju sve pločice iste boje – prvi koji uzme iz tog centralnog mjesta uzima i token za prvog igrača ali taj token tj. pločica ide na mjesto na vašem „zidiću“ za negativne bodove te vrijedi jedan negativni bod. Pločice koje se uzmu iz manufakture moraju se postaviti samo u jedan red na ploči, odnosno ne mogu se kombinirati tako da se stavljaju u više redova. Sve pločice koje igrač ne može legalno postaviti, idu u red s negativnom bodovima.

Nakon svake runde pločice koje ste završili prebacuju se na drugu stranu ploče, te se tamo i boduju. Sve što se nije uspjelo prebaciti na drugu stranu ploče (ili u palaču) ostaje na ploči za drugi krug pa to može nekad biti problem ako nemate gdje staviti legalno pločice, pa onda moraju ići u negativni red.

Azul se igra dok jedan igrač ne popuni sve (pet) pločice u jednoj horizontali na svojoj ploči, pa se uglavnom igra 5 krugova.

Kratki zaključak :
Ovo je za mene jedna od najboljih apstraktnih igara koje sam ikad igrao. Vrlo jednostavna a opet možete planirati i taktizirati, pogotovo u dva igrača. Lijepo izgleda na stolu. Svi kojima sam ovu igru pokazao su je ili kupili ili sam ju poklonio dragim ljudima.

Ovo mi je i igra koju vrlo rado pokazujem novim igračima i imam sigurno preko 100 partija odigrane igre. Ujedno Azul je igra koju nikad ne bi izbacio iz svoje kolekcije – jednostavno je must have!

THE GOOD
- Jako jednostavna igra za naučiti
- Jako lijepe pločice
- Jasna pravila
- Brzi gameplay oko 20 minuta ili manje ako nemate AP
- Lako odigrate par partija zaredom

THE BAD
- Ako moram cjepidlačiti: onda je minus to što ploča na kojoj se stavlja score token i pločice nemaju udubljena u sebi, pa pločice znaju kliziti (to je riješeno s ekspanzijom, inače meni ne smeta)
- Ljudi često imaju problema s zbrajanjem bodova u igri na početku
- Kad se igra u dvoje, igra može biti malo na nož – ni ovo meni ne smeta

MY TIPS & TRICKS
- Bodovi idu do 100 a ponekad i preko, no većina rezultata ako igrate dobro kreće se oko 80 bodova
- Paziti kako postavljate pločice; pokušajte planirati unaprijed, pogotovo kad igrate u dvoje i možete pretpostaviti što vaš protivnik može napraviti.
- Pokušajte slagati pločice što bliže jednu drugoj jer tako ćete dobiti više bodova
- I ako možete probajte napraviti barem jednu vertikalu i složiti sve boje, ako možete više još bolje – tu se dobiva dosta bodova

Tema 21: Extra little variant that scratches that completionist itch for me
Pregunta:
When I play Azul, it feels odd to me that the game ends when a player finishes a row as there is still some of the board left to fill. As a result, I came up with a little extension to the game where instead of the game finishing once the bonus points have been awarded, the game continues (with no more bonus points) until someone has filled in their board. This works well with two players, but with more players there are not enough tiles so we just play until the tiles are gone. This also has the incentive for players to fill in the lower levels instead of just the top rows as in the late game you're bound to lose a lot of points if you fill in your top rows too quickly.
After I created this rule, it turned out to be useful when one of the people I was playing with nudged one of the other players to take a strategically bad move to avoid ending the game that costed him 11 points. The next game I decided to implement this rule, with their knowledge, and she no longer tried to influence him to not finish the game.

Does it have a   logo on the front cover and their copyright info on the back cover, just like every other legit copy of the game? If not, then you bought a counterfeit.

Respuesta 9:
No, my parents (in their 70s) purchased it a while ago. I asked if it was shrinkwrapped etc. They said they it was brand new from Amazon.

Amazingly they love playing games and I was round at their house tonight and we pulled it out and they said it comes with these extra see-through tiles, but we don't know what they are for. So, myself being a somewhat younger gamer at 52, I decided to check out these forums.

There are two rule books in the game, one English and one (Chinese or Japanese)

Respuesta 10:
Unless the rulebook says something about them (and I would love to see what they say!), then you can disregard these 20 extra tiles. I have no idea how you would play Azul with six types of tiles. It is hard enough with five

His 70 year old parents DID buy an original, as far as they knew. In fact they could have ordered a legit copy from a legit seller and been done-over by the Amazon process. It's well documented that Amazon mixes stock from different sellers and then justs sends out whichever comes to hand when an order is placed. People are researching and buying from genuine stores and still getting fake copies. For all we know their money has gone to a legit store, with the publisher getting their cut and the buyers have been stiffed. (also possible they bought it from a dodgy seller on Amazon, but even if that's the case it sounds like they intended to buy a real one and thought Amazon was trustworthy.)

I'd suggest in this case maybe the pensioners could be cut a break?

Do they? Is Amazon a "genuine" store? More like a different storefront for Ali Express. I'm pretty sure that if you buy games from a "genuine" store, you won't get fake copy. I mean, here in Poland, it's literally impossible to get a fake copy in any store, either brick and mortar or online. Only on Ali, but that's like, common knowledge. If you're paying $10 for a game with free shipment, there's no way it could ever be genuine.

Can you walk me through the logic process here? How would publisher get their cut in this scenario?

I want to live in a world without cheap ripoffs, fakes and copies, so that actual good products can be made and sold with profit, sustained. In order to do that, we cannot just turn a blind eye to the counterfeit process. I will always ask (ask!) people to get the real product, without judging or interrogating them on how they've obtained the fake one in the first place. Just because you thought you've bought the real thing, still doesn't make it right with the original maker/creator/publisher. All I'm saying is do them solid next time you have a chance.

So while Amazon does have the 'AliExpress' crowd on it, it is also used by Bricks and Mortar (or genuine online) stores who know that customers often only go to Amazon. (the only named example I can think of off the top of my head actually does their own fulfilment so isn't the best example - The Entertainer)
I could go onto Amazon and see a game listed with multiple sellers and pick 'Legit Game Store I recognise'. My payment will go through the Amazon system and be passed on to the Legit Game Store who have bought their stock from the publisher and the whole financial aspect of the transaction is the same as me walking into their store and buying it.
HOWEVER because of the Amazon stock mixing policy, their picker might actually pick up a copy of the game that was provided by 'AliExpress store 1' and send it to me. (and when someone else orders from the dodgy store they are going to get my real copy). Now, when the dodgy game arrives, if I realise the error I can report it to Amazon who will take it back and try again.

Is the 'do they?' about the mixing of stock? - yes they do, at least here in the UK. There are reports from Amazon employees online, and IIRC there are even confirmations here on BGG in our 'UK hot deals' forum. Some bricks and mortar stores don't have the staff to be able to manage fulfilment so they deliver their stock in bulk to the Amazon Warehouse and let Amazon do the logistics. Amazon does not segregate this stock by seller. It all just goes on the shelf and mixes with stock from other sellers.

Genuine Store: I wasn't referring to Amazon as being the genuine store - I was referring to the seller who was using the Amazon platform as being the genuine store.

You're making an assumption there that they paid, say, $10 with free shipment for the game. I have a few observations on that:
- If they've been the victim of Amazon mixing then they would have paid the market price.
- Fraudsters have long realised that a cheap price flags up fakes. There is an approach of setting the price just below the expected level so that it's cheaper but not 'too good to be true'. It makes people think they are buying a genuine product, and they fakers make even more money.
- With Amazon in particular, it is possible for something to drop in price quite dramatically for a few hours/days because of their algorithm, so low prices are a red flag for possible fakes, but not definitive.
- For another example of that, there was a point a few years ago where Amazon UK had loads of German versions of games and was selling them dirt cheap. A few people on here were suspicious but once the orders came in it was clear they were genuine copies. There was much discussion at the time. Speculation linked it to clearing warehouses because of Brexit but I don't think we ever got an official answer, and we are still seeing examples pop up, albeit less frequently.
- And using Azul and your $10s is quite a coincidence - A couple of years ago one of our clearance stores in the Midlands did actually have a batch of Azul going for £10. They were genuine copies, probably liquidation stock from a FLGS or something. These prices do happen sometimes.

I don't want to make assumptions about OPs parents, but from the post it sounds like they thought they were buying a genuine copy of a game. In general older folks aren't as aware of the recent influx of fakes and how bad Amazon is at letting them be sold, but maybe I shouldn't make assumptions.

I do appreciate your wider point, and if someone intenionally bought a fake I wouldn't have commented. But my point was, if a consumer buys what they think is a genuine copy then perhaps they get the benefit of the doubt. Telling them to buy another copy feels like Victim Blaming. Perhaps we should be getting annoyed at Amazon for allowing these fakes to proliferate instead of taking it out on a couple of folks who sound like they are bystanders in all this?

Thanks for describing this. Interesting. But does that actually happen or are you depicting a theoretical scenario? My understanding is that if you're purchasing from "Legit Game Store" via Amazon, the process looks differently and Amazon merely acts as a proxy/third party. It's the actual store that conducts the shipment (even if through Amazon warehouse). With all the labeling and automation, does that really happen, that Amazon would do some kind of mixup at this stage? I'm not nitpicking, I'm genuinely curious. It never happened to me, but I'm hardly an active buyer on Amazon (probably around 100 purchases total). I can totally see the mixup being more likely when you're just "purchasing from Amazon" and there is some kind of underlying assumption, that even if you buy from Amazon, they're pulling from a single set of stock, that, for example, comes from the publisher. But that stock can change over time and be sourced from other places - this is when people report in comments that they've "received a different version" or something similar.

No, no, I've never suggested that. I meant that here in Poland it is widely understood that if you're paying $10 from Ali Express for a product that is priced $40 everywhere else, then it has to be a Chinese counterfeit and not a fantastic bargain. Some people are just ok with that and they know they're buying fakes. Or, in other words, noone ever expects an original product from Ali.

All good points and I fully agree. This whole line of thought went in a wrong direction, because someone derived from a single line, that I'm attacking OP's family. I really didn't intend my comment to be a judgement. Like mentioned before, it's not about how they've obtained the product and not about judging this particular situation. From the photos it was instantly obvious to me, that it is a fake and I smiled that someone, after so many red flags, thought that maybe this is still a genuine product. There's nothing wrong with it, it's a normal human response, no one likes to be cheated, so we have our defense mechanisms in place for that. I should know, I was a victim of this couple times, when purchasing electronics locally (for the same price as regular retail!) only to find out that it is a fake ripoff, albeit very well made on the outside (hint: the firmware usually gives it away).

When it was established that it is a fake, I've just inserted a piece of my worldview - a request (not a demand!) to buy a genuine product. That's all. It wasn't even directed at the initial buyer, but to the OP - now that they've come here, so I can assume that their awareness is much broader. At the same time, I must admit, that it felt somewhat weird, when I am scolded on the biggest board game place on the internet - frequently visited by designers, producers and publishers - for merely asking to do the right thing. It's as if the right thing wasn't the right thing? So you've accidentally purchased a counterfeit. Its ok, no one's reporting you to the police or sending a dead fish wrapped in a newspaper at your doorstep, these things happen. Still, please purchase the original. Maybe as a gift to your friends?

Actually happens according the Amazon employees posting in different forums across the internet. I did a quick google and found a UK site explaining pros and cons of the co-mingling, and an older US article talking about it.

Tema 23: What is the best guide or explanation to learning Azul

We are almost giving up.. and we are not that dumb ! When checking out How to play rules videos, this is a few comments I copy pasted from random Azul videos:

I watched the video and I still have no idea how to play
I found this video on board game arena. I watched it, and still haven't the slightest clue how to play the game
I feel dumb because I watched the entire video and still feel lost as to how to play this damn game.

We are almost giving up.. and we are not that dumb !
Probably the worst way for a group to learn a game, is for everyone to gather together on gamenight and pick a YouTube video, just before playing. This is what the OP's scenario sounds like.

To avoid such failures in future, don't turn to videos in the first instance. Ideally, one person should study the rulebook before gamenight, thus enabling them to teach it to the others before playing.

We all learn differently and that’s perfectly fine. There definitely are some terrible rulebooks out there, but most of them are perfectly fine so that shouldn’t prevent you from reading a rulebook when your favorite learning method didn’t work. You’re clearly struggling a lot to learn from videos this time around, so it’s probably better to change your approach. This is a very light and easy game to play. In my experience, what usually confuses newcomers the most is the scoring… believe me, reading the scoring example from the rulebook can do wonders if none of you can teach the rest of the group.

One thing that I would say as the designated teacher who often introduces new games to complete beginners is that it’s usually a bad idea to learn a new game together from scratch on a game night. The group dynamics can slow the process down quite a bit. Not to mention that if one of you spaces out and distracts the others, you can all miss important bits of the video and misunderstand the rules. It’s usually better if one of you learns how to play ahead of time and then teaches the rest of the group. Yes, someone will end up doing some homework but as a result the game nights will proceed faster once one of you is able to teach the game and to answer all the questions. Hope this helps

Respuesta 12:
All the above is spot on: Use the rule book for Azul, and designate a teacher to learn the game before game night. But to answer your original question, in general I will use videos from JonGetsGames, BeforeYouPlay and WatchItPlayed. I see that JonGetsGames has a video on Azul, so that is the one I would use. If one of them is not there I will default to the rule book. In my experience most if not all of the others have significant errors in their "teach" Rahdo is also fun and gives a lot of ideas on why, but he makes so many errors I would not use him for a cold teach. Paul Grogan is also good, but I don't seemany of his teaches in games I am interested in.

Respuesta 13:
In summary,
On your turn, take ALL the tiles of one colour from one of the discs( or from the centre). Place them in a single row on the left side of your mat. If they don't all fit, place the excess on the "floor" row at the bottom of the mat. All the tiles in a normal row must be the same colour. If you are the first to take tiles form the centre, you must also take the white tile which goes to the floor. Play then goes to the next player.
Repeat until all the tiles on the mat and centre are all used.

Once all the tiles are used go to the scoring phase:
Move a single tile from each completed row to the wall you are building. Start at the top and work down. Score it immediately. one point for each tile you place, AND one point for each tile immediately adjacent
X will score one point
XY will score two points
XYZ will score three points and so on.
Remove all other tiles from that row to the discard pile (the rulebook says to put them in the box lid. I use a second bag.
Leave any in complete rows for the next round.

This works for both rows and columns. Treat them separately so playing X like this:
XYZ
Y
Z
W

will score three for the row, and four for the column, giving a total of seven points for placing the X but placing
XYZ

Y
Z
will score just 1 point.

and
XYZ
YX
Z

Will score 4 points (two for column, two for row)

Once you have scored all COMPLETE rows, subtract points for any tiles that have fallen to the floor. The points for each floor tile is printed on the play mat.

At the end of the final round, score any completed rows, columns and colour sets according to the chart printed on the play mat.

There is WAY more poor YT tutorial videos than poor rulebooks. Different people have different preferences when learning the game, but the rulebook is always your one and only source of truth. It's also the only resource you have at hand (literally), to consult when actually playing the game.

Azul rulebook is perfectly fine. The game is very popular, especially among the casual crowd. If there was a problem with the rulebook, that simply couldn't be the case.



Tema 24: Ghost/dummy player for 2 players game idea - less cutthroat
Pregunta:
I'm looking to play this with family members who aren't really gamers. In most case it will be at 2 player count with occasional 3. I'm seeing a lot of potential meanness and cutthroat scenario that could resulted from play with only 2 players.
So I'm thinking of maybe adding a third ghost player. Not exactly an automata that will try to win the game, but adding some randomness that will make the round less "solved", and potentially less cutthroat.
I'm thinking of rolling dice to choose factory or middle, then rolling a dice to pick which one the AI will take (either a d4 so the bigger group is more likely to get picked, or dX where each color get equal chance). Another option would be to roll a dice to determine color and just pick a factory with the biggest group.

Any thoughts? The goal isn't trying to add a competent third player, but to cut the edge off of 2 player game a little.

Respuesta 1:
Before trying to think of variants, I suggest playing it as is. I can definitely understand how you think it could be too cutthroat, but in my experience, it’s not (at any player count). Because if players are too cutthroat, they will be spiting themselves in a lot of cases, and making the end result worse for them.

Tema 27: Clarification on refilling the tile bag
Pregunta:
I recently taught this to the family while on vacation after playing a number of times on BGA.

What caught be out was the bag refilling, as on BGA it was always automated.

It is clear you are supposed to only do it once, ever. However, in a four player game that feels like ....a stretch. just over 1/3 of all tiles are placed in depots every round, and you need at least five rounds to have a row being possible but my no means compulsory.

For these games with family I just kept collecting the discards and putting them back in. I think it was done 3 or 4 times in these games. Once game went 6 rounds, the other went 8.

These were also learning games so the amount of tiles stuck on boards may have been a little higher than average. Once I broke the "just once" rule it felt foolish to try to hold on to it.

Am I missing something?

Respuesta 1:
There is no “just once” rule. At the start of each round you fill as much as you can from the bag. If that isn’t enough, put all the discards in the bag.

Respuesta 2:
Eddie the Cranky Gamer
@apotheos
It is clear you are supposed to only do it once, ever.
I'm missing where the game sets out a rule that you should only recycle the tiles once.

Here's what I see in the rules :

Quote:
C. Preparing the next round
If nobody has completed a horizontal line of 5 consecutive tiles on her wall yet (see End of the game), prepare the next round. The player with the starting player marker refills each of the Factory displays with 4 tiles from the bag as in the setup. If the bag is empty, refill it with all the tiles that you have placed in the lid of the game box and then continue filling the remaining Factory displays. Then, start the new round.

In the rare case that you run out of tiles again while there are none left in the lid, start the new round as usual even though not all Factory displays are properly filled.

Respuesta 3:
Yeah that’s describing what happens when there aren’t enough tiles in the bag even once you have added all the discards.

Respuesta 4:
What I’ve done here is to add an extra cloth bag to the game - all the discards go in the extra bag, and then when the first bag is empty, we just switch to using the other one. Then all the discards go in the original bag. If the new one empties before the game finishes, we switch back. Etc, ad infinitum, or at least until the game ends.

so smart! seems like it shouldn't be very hard to pour the tiles from the box lid into the bag and yet we always have to be quite careful or risk dropping tiles all over. I saw a very pretty cardstock tower someone made, to hold the discards and then make pouring into bag easier. but I never considered just having a second bag instead!?! genius!

Probably something like that; putting tiles in a row is actually the main objective and you’ll rarely get more than one done anyway.

Giving more points for columns and Colors makes it a more strategic game.

Respuesta 3:
Well, creating a row is not that hard because you could do it with as few as 5 tiles (top row). Much more interesting to try and make players create a column for more points.

Respuesta 4:
Columns are harder to make than rows, so it makes sense that they are worth more.

Horizontal rows aren't really challenging so I can see why they aren't really scored highly. If anything it more of a little bonus for triggering the end of the game.

True, but you still don’t want the horizontal rows to be a points incentive nor game decider. It’s much more exciting for us to see if we can get the 5 colours, plus multi- columns, while collecting 7 point placements along the way!!!



Tema 29: Azul, durch Bordspelwereld [DE]
Pregunta:
Azul ist ein Spiel des Verlags Plan B Games. Dieses Spiel kann entweder mit 2, 3 oder 4 Spielern gespielt werden. Jeder baut eine Mauer mit schönen Fliesen in der Alhambra. Und natürlich muss man die meisten Punkte sammeln, um das Spiel zu gewinnen.

Zu Beginn des Spiels liegen je nach Spielerzahl einige runde Plättchen auf dem Tisch. Auf jedem dieser Plättchen befinden sich 4 Spielsteine in verschiedenen Farben. Wenn du an der Reihe bist, nimmst du ein Plättchen einer bestimmten Farbe von einem Plättchen. Du musst alle Plättchen der gewählten Farbe nehmen, wenn es also 2 oder 3 sind, nimmst du diese 2 oder 3 und nicht nur 1. Die restlichen Plättchen dieser Scheibe kommen in die Tischmitte.

Irgendwann möchte oder muss jemand die Plättchen aus der Mitte des Tisches nehmen. Auch hier nimmt man alle Plättchen dieser Farbe, die man gewählt hat. Der erste Spieler, der ein Plättchen aus der Mitte nimmt, erhält ein Plättchen, das er für -1 Punkt auf seinem Spielplan ablegt, aber er ist der Startspieler der nächsten Runde.

Wenn ein Spieler ein Plättchen gewählt hat, legt er es auf seinen Spielplan. Von links nach rechts müssen die Reihen gefüllt werden. Die oberste Reihe ist bereits mit 1 Plättchen gefüllt, die nächsten 2, 3 und die unterste Reihe braucht 5 Plättchen der gleichen Farbe. Wenn ein Spieler Plättchen genommen hat, die er nicht auf seinem Spielplan unterbringen kann, werden sie in die unterste Reihe gelegt, was jede Runde Strafpunkte bringt.

Wenn alle Plättchen vom Tisch genommen wurden, ist die erste Runde beendet und es findet eine Wertung statt. Von allen gesammelten Plättchen darf, sofern die Reihe voll ist, ein Plättchen an die Wand gelegt werden, die anderen kommen in den Vorrat. Alle gebauten Plättchen bringen 1 oder mehr Punkte.

Am Ende des Spiels gibt es Extrapunkte, wenn man eine waagerechte Reihe von Plättchen fertiggestellt hat; hat ein Spieler das geschafft, ist das Spiel vorbei und dies war die letzte Runde. Auch wer eine Spalte von Spielsteinen oder alle Spielsteine einer Farbe fertigstellt, erhält zusätzliche Bonuspunkte.

Die andere Seite des Spielbretts hat einen zusätzlichen Schwierigkeitsgrad: Die Felder sind grau, so dass man sich aussuchen kann, auf welches Feld man ein bestimmtes Farbplättchen legt, solange die Regel eingehalten wird, dass ein Farbplättchen nur in einer Reihe oder Spalte vorkommen darf. Das nebenstehende Bild zeigt, dass ein Spieler damit Schwierigkeiten hatte.

Fazit: Auch wenn jeder seine eigene Mauer baut, ist es gut, seine Mitspieler im Auge zu behalten. Welche Plättchen schnappt man sich jetzt vom Tisch und welche versucht man später zu bekommen. Manchmal ist es auch eine Taktik, den Gegnern viele Minuspunkte aufzubürden... Es ist ein sehr farbenfrohes und fröhliches Spiel und lädt auf jeden Fall zum Wiederspielen ein.

Tema 30: Possible fake
Pregunta:
I received a copy of Azul yesterday, purchased from eBay. I am thinking it's a fake. Initial differences from pictures and descriptions that I have seen are:

1. The bag is beige and plain with no pattern at all as opposed to a blue printed, patterned bag
2. The tiles are light, hollow plastic (like even cheaper Scrabble tiles). I understand that the tiles should feel weighty and are made of a resin or similar better quality material.
There may be more differences. Hard to know without an original copy to compare with.

Can anyone help me determine if this is a counterfeit?

Thanks

Respuesta 1:
I'd say it is counterfeit, yes.

Have a look through the Pictures under the Azul entry, your bag and tiles should look like these, a blue pattern bag and solid plastic tiles. Some of the tiles in your picture look like they've been printed badly too, that face-up yellow tile on the left, the red pattern looks very off-centre.

This is what I thought too. Azul mini does have that same hollow design tile, and I believe is not made of the same heavy plastic (what people call "bakelite", although it's a misnomer), so the fact that the tiles are that shape and made of that material isn't by itself a clue that it is counterfeit. But if the bag is wrong, and the box doesn't say "Azul Mini", then obviously it's not right.

The phrase comes from the cuckoo egg masquerading as another birds egg in their nest so the mother unwittingly looks after it as if it was her own, so a "fake egg" in that regard.

We do? Never seen them (thought they are who you say they are). And, actually what's the point? If they're making a fake, they clearly have the original material to compare against. They thrive on people who don't know the original and buying games from shady places. Why would they go to the single biggest professional community to check if their knock off can pass as original? Here they have the biggest chance that people would point out all the differences. And, in the process, it's also exposure to publishers, who read this and have sometimes direct means to counterattack?

These people either copy almost 1:1, so that the difference is barely recognisable (mobile bluetooth speakers are plagued by this, i.e. JBL), or they don't try to copy 1:1 at all, do "whatever" and shrug.



Tema 31: Question for those of you who own multiple reimplementations of Azul and log plays...
Pregunta:
Is it weird or unreasonable to log plays of, for example, Sintra under "base" Azul? I've only played the original but will probably be getting Sintra. They seem close enough to me that I'm thinking I'll probably just log plays of Sintra under Azul, almost as an "exansion". Does anyone do this or are they distinct enough that this wouldn't really make sense? Obviously doesn't really matter, but I am curious.

Respuesta 1:
To me, each Azul game is different enough to be logged separately. But then there are the chocolate and mini versions that really are just reskins, so I'd likely log those under base Azul. Maybe see if you can log it under the Azul family category rather than a particular game. This works well for Unmatched where there is a first set released chronologically, but any set can be a 'base' set.

I play a lot of Unmatched and Dice Throne, where this very thing is applicable, which is why I thought of it. Ticket to Ride is another one where I'll log under the base game regardless of the map I'm actually playing. Azul doesn't have an overarching category like Unmatched or Dice Throne, so I would have to either log them separately or just under base Azul.

Respuesta 3:
I’ve played all of the different Azuls, and I think of them as siblings. Same family, but definitely unique enough to log plays under their own game. I get what you’re saying, and I’d agree if they were all just reskins, like the Azul chocolate one, but Sintra, Pavilion, and Queen’s Garden all have their own unique twists and gameplay. (Personally, I prefer the original and Queen’s Garden over the middle “kids.”) In the big scheme of things though, whatever works best for you is great. Enjoy!

Respuesta 4:
I have PnP boards  for Azul in my copy of Sintra, so for me those 2 are quite literally a 2-in-1 package. Sintra includes everything you need to play the original Azul once you print these.

As for logging, I’m using BGStats to log games, which allows me to create variants and filter everything easily. For a while I logged them both under Sintra, but I eventually got tired of filtering every time. I find it more effective to keep them separate when it comes to this.

That's fair. I will also use those PnP files for base Azul when I get Sintra, which is another reason I began considering this.

I use Board Record instead of BGStats to log plays, and I could either set Sintra as an "expansion", or simply just tag the play with "Sintra" to easily be able to filter stats.

Tema 32: My Brute Force program found 113-points is the maximum for a 17-placement game in 5-rounds of play
Pregunta:
I'm an advanced programmer but beginner-Azul player who knows a lot of things about brute-force calculations of various games. I was introduced to the game of Azul recently, and upon my search online, I couldn't find anyone trying to "brute force optimize" and find the best set of placements possible. Now note, this "optimal" play is still incredibly optimistic. But with a theoretical play within 5-rounds and with "most of the play" in row 1/2/3, it seems reasonably pragmatic to me.

The TL;DR: I used dynamic programming / tablebase technique to brute force all possible placements of Azul assuming that exactly 17 placements happen. I can tweak my program to output an ideal 16 or 18 placement if you all wish, but 17 seemed to be what Azul players consider "reasonable" in their games.

This placement achieves 36-points final-score bonus, as well as 77-points throughout the game. Its 5x placements of 1-point happen in the first round (albeit with an unlikely draw of 9x reds required), but afterwards scores a minimum of 4-points per placement in round2, an overall-average of 4.5 points per placement throughout the game and solidly 6+ points on every placement in the later rounds.

-------------

There are somewhere near 62-million overall "optimal games" of 113-points of 17-placements, but many of these games require more than 5-rounds to be played. Filtering down for "possible within 5-round games", they drop down to exactly 4746 (113-points / 17-placements / 5 rounds). This one I decided to post here is the one set of placements that most-favors the top-side of the board.

Because my program is written in a simple brute-force manner, I expect that I've discovered the best possible placements (assuming 17-placements in a game).

----------

Other notes:

* An optimal 113-point placement exists for 23 of the 25 opening moves (though not necessarily within 5-rounds of play). Only the top-left and bottom-right tiles are poor, every other move can possibly lead to a perfectly scored game.

* Of the 2nd move, ~14ish of the 25 next moves (depending on which move you selected) remain on the optimal path of 113-points by endgame. This suggests that Azul is a game of "many many" optimal moves and games, meaning that other elements of the game are more important than optimizing for your own personal high-score.

* This brute-force calculator disfavors 2-point and 3-point placements, and always picks a placement such that only 5x 1-point placements occur. This pattern exists in all the placements I've hand-verified. The later moves are 4-point through 8-point, but they don't seem "as important" in practice.

* Order matters. Many placements go bottom-up instead of top-down. It takes a very complex, brute-force, search for me to find the "top down" placements that optimize the game.

---------

Open questions:

* I'm a beginner at Azul. I've found 6-round 17-placements that favor the 2nd row (instead of the 3rd row like in this solution) while still achieving 113 points. What's more important? A plan that works in 5-rounds (but uses the more difficult 5x placements on the 3rd row), or a plan that works in 6-rounds but is easier to pull off due to 5x placements on the 2nd row?

* The ideal 16-placements ends with 99 points, and 15 much much less. Aiming for fewer points will "lock in" your gains and likely be easier to achieve in practice. However, aiming for higher placements (ie: 17-placement game or 18-placement game) leads to dramatic increases in score. I'm not sure if 17-placement was the ideal to aim for... its just the starting point for discussion. Does anyone know what a "typical" game of Azul hits in 5 rounds? Please respond as I'm a beginner in Azul with very little practical experience. If I knew what a typical endgame was it'd help.

Respuesta 1:
"113-points in 17-placements"

My high score is 105 points in a four player game. I must have been flying under the radar with my opponents not thwarting my plans. (Possibly there was an extra placement involved.)

Respuesta 2:
Same to me, 115 points on a 3 player game (with the other two rookies Who never stop me to do point

Respuesta 3:
The biggest surprise to me from this exercise is the shear number of "optimal games" that exist. Some human out there almost certainly played optimally at least once. Again: nearly 62-million such optimal games exist for this 17-placement case (though it may take anywhere from 5-rounds to lol 13+ rounds to play out or beyond).

I posit that some lucky few have played perfectly optimally: reaching the maximum score possible. But maybe in 6, 7 or 8 rounds instead of the (rather difficult) 5-round case I posted here.

----------

The next steps, now that the optimal scores have been developed, is to figure out reliability. How can we play in such a way to have a maximum-score game as often as possible? Or alternatively, can we play more reliably (but maybe less-than-maximum) that still scores very high and beats many of our foes? There's plenty of open questions still.

Respuesta 4:
Very interesting, but I didn't really understand why 17 placements was such a golden number. Why limit it to 17 placements? I can understand the 5 round parameter, but how would more placement correspond to higher score if we removed the limitation of placements?

That has to do with the nature of the algorithm I devised. My brute-force algorithm cannot function unless I choose exactly how many placements to plan for.

It has nothing to do with the "game" per se. But it does mean I need an expert's opinion if my assumption of 17 was reasonable or not. I can change the number quickly and get you a new analysis tomorrow or maybe Friday, if you have a different number you'd like.

Or maybe I should just do all placements: 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, and 20 placements? That should probably cover all reasonable games??

Respuesta 6:
Analysis Complete.



I kept the search on 5-rounds, so 14, 15, and 16 probably can be done in fewer rounds... in fact that might be ideal so that you can get more points than anyone who tries to end the game early.

15-placement is very unlikely to me: though its only 3 placements per round, it requires 3x 4th row and 3x 5th row as its going for the triple vertical column endgame strategy. Still good to know however.

17 is surprisingly, the first optimal placement that ends the game (a full row somewhere). So that's interesting to know at least.

Super cool! How long does the brute force approach take to run on your machine with the 19 placement search?

It takes like ~30 seconds to find "A Perfect Placement", but something closer to ~1 hour to find something within 5 rounds, sort them all and then pick the one with "most placements on top row / least placements on bottom row". I accomplish this by brute-forcing my brute-force, generating all possible placements, filtering out the ones that'd take longer than 5-rounds to accomplish... and then running "sort" against my heuristic (0 points on the 1st row, 1-point on the 2nd row, 5-points on the 3rd row, 25-points on the 4th row, 125-points on the 5th row, exponentially favoring placements on the top of the chart).

I... probably could optimize this 2nd step more carefully, and also multithread the operation (its all single-threaded right now)... but I'm not even sure if "finding 5-round placements" to 19+ boards (aka: 4ish pieces per round?? That's obviously unlikely) is worth discovering.

I do have "a" placement on 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, and 25 if anyone cares. But... its not within 5 rounds, and therefore I don't think they're practical to talk about. I did let the computer try to run for these ("try to find 5-round" on 20-placement, 21-placement, etc. etc.), but no solution was found after ~3 hours of searching. But I'm not really concerned with figuring these obviously obscure cases out.

----------

I'm at the point where I need simply expertise in the game to figure out "what I should be searching for". I'm thinking ~3 round placements of 9 pieces, or maybe I should search for "opening patterns" that lead to high-scoring 14, 16, 17, and 18 potential positions (highest flexibility across low-scoring games vs high-scoring games), or something. I dunno.

But at least _this_ subproblem is solved.

----------

If you create a perfect placement in 5-rounds, then you're going to either win the game or tie for the top. So given the knowledge of perfect placements, it makes little sense to search for 6-round or 7-round placements IMO.

Maybe if you went for a low-scoring ~14-placement 5-round game, then noticed that the opponent will win, so you want to extend the game to 6-rounds and maybe 18-placement or 19 placement?? I dunno, but its clearly more niche situation than aiming at 5-rounds (or less) placements.

Case in point: if you go for the 16-placement game and everyone else is ~16 placements or less, then you win. (!!). There do not seem to be any 16-placements available in 5-rounds that have a 5-row filled out (so game will not end). So someone else needs to go for a 17-placement game (not necessarily the perfect 113 point game, but 100-point or above) to beat any conservative 16-placement player. But its difficult to achieve ~3 placements/round in my experience (let alone of an optimal sequence like demonstrated here).

--------

Maybe what I really want to search for is: "maximum points by round 3, with still a chance to achieve 16, 17, or 18 placement by round 5", so that we have flexibility in a variety of games. But such coding would take more effort on my behalf....

Respuesta 10:
I like this analysis,! I feel like something that in practice should be very important its the best 3/4/5/6 placements scores since these give you more "short term view" and flexible strategies you can follow when you play.

For example, I know that create corners is a good way to get "extra points" and optimizes 3 placement strategy (like the one you see on the 14 moves 1,2,3 placements).



Tema 33: Azul, by Bordspelwereld [EN]
Pregunta:
Azul is a game from the publisher Plan B Games. This game can be played with 2, 3 or 4 players. Everyone builds a wall with beautiful tiles in the Alhambra. And of course earn the most points to win the game.

At the beginning of the game, depending on the number of players, there are a few round disks on the table. There are 4 tiles on each of those disks randomly drawn from a bag. When it is your turn, you take tiles of a certain color from one disk. You must take all tiles of your chosen color, so if there are 2 or 3, you take 2 or 3 and not just 1. The remaining tiles from that disk go to the center of the table.
At some point a player wants or needs to take the tiles from the center of the table. If so, they take all the tiles of the color their choose. The first player to choose from the middle of the table receives a special token and places it on their game board for -1 point, but they will be the starting player for the next round.
Once a player has chosen tiles, they place them on their game board. The rows must be filled from left to right. The top row is already full with 1 tile, the subsequent rows need one tile more, and the 5th row needs 5 of the same color tiles. If a player has taken tiles that they cannot place on their board, these tiles must be placed on the bottom row, which will result in penalty points at the end of the round.
When all tiles have been taken from the table, the first round is over and a scoring takes place. Of all the collected tiles, provided the row is full, one may be placed on the wall, the other tiles go aside to the supply. All built tiles earn 1 or more points.
At the end of the game you get extra points if you have completed a horizontal row of tiles. As soon as a player has done that, the game is over and this is the last round. Completing a column of tiles or all tiles of 1 color, also gains you extra bonus points.
The other side of the player board has an extra level of difficulty, the fields are gray so you can decide for yourself on which field you place a certain color tile, as long as the rule is complied with that one color tile may only appear in one row or column. The photo below shows that a player got into trouble with this.

Conclusion:
Even though everyone is building their own wall, it is still good to keep an eye on your opponents. Which tiles do you take from the table now and which ones do you try to get later? Sometimes it is also a tactic to force your opponents to take an amount of tiles resulting in a lot of negative points.
It is a very colorful and cheerful game and certainly invites you to play again.

Tema 34: Missing Piece
Pregunta:
Recommendations for picking up a single red tile? I purchased a copy used, and that's the only thing missing. (Worst case, I'll hit up eBay, but the shipping prices for a single tile are a bit high...)

Respuesta 1:
I was going to say you could replace them with the promo tiles, but all of those are way over priced. You could source an entire copy of Azul for what they want.

Otherwise, eBay is ~$6 for a single tile.

Otherwise, what I'd do is when you discard a red tile at the first turn of the game, throw one back in the bag. Not perfect, but close enough (1% chance difference on the first draw).

Indeed. I've thrifted this game a few times, but all of them were complete so I either kept them or gifted them. I make components available for any incomplete games I acquire, and so I imagine there's someone out there with parts available.

Respuesta 6:
Were you talking about the 2022-onward Spare Parts Resource List or the "has parts" section under the Azul page Azul has parts? I see "notclive" has a red tile. You can send them a message seeing if it's still available.

For anyone else that didn't know about the "has parts" section, on any game page, go down about 1/4 of the way. Right after the description section, you will see "official links" on the left, "community stats" in the middle and "want in trade / has parts / needs parts". I believe this all comes from the same section when you add a game to your collection drop down. You just click on advanced and at the bottom it will be part of the "parts exchange" section.



Tema 35: Close Game

Tonight I played a game of Azul with three friends which was notable primarily for the very close scores, thus…

Heather: 86 points
Lisa: 87 points, one complete row
Olivia: 87 points, one complete row
Travis: 87 points, three complete rows

I won on the tiebreak, but a 1-point difference between 1st and 4th is nail-biting!



Tema 36: "Stack Attack" Solo Variant for Azul
Pregunta:
I'm super excited to share this solo variant that I have had in the works for over a year, and am just now getting to polish it up enough to where I feel I can share it with the community.

You can find it in the Files section here:
https://boardgamegeek.com/filepage/271034/stack-attack-solo-...

The rules are super easy to understand, as they are condensed into a single page that can easily be printed and folded up / placed in the box.

I'd love to hear any feedback anyone who plays it might have.

This was a really fun solo variant to design and I personally really enjoy playing it and hope others will too!

Here is the basic premise of the solo mode, taken directly from the "Overview" section of the one pager:

The "Stack Attack" opponent (hereafter refered to as
your opponent) will draft tiles during the drafting
phase and will stack tiles onto your board during the
round cleanup phase, scoring points almost as
usual except using your wall to do so. When your
opponent scores points in the game, move
his marker (that started at 100) backwards.
His score will be 100 minus the position of his
marker at the end of the game.



Tema 37: Azul expansion - "must" or "only" play a tile of that color on reserved spaces?
Pregunta:
In the Azul ("Crystal Mosaic?") expansion, the boards have one space of each color - one per row/column (sorry for the imprecise explanation). The rules say that only a tile of that color can be played on that space.
Within our family, we are having a disagreement over the meaning of that rule. Specifically, does it mean that I cannot play a tile of any other color on that tile, or that the space is considered "reserved" for that color?
The practical difference is whether or not a player can choose to not play that space at all, and (according to the first interpretation) play that color tile in a different space in that row or column. In the second interpretation, even if I choose not to play a tile in that "reserved" space, I can't play a tile of that color anywhere else in that row or column anyway.
It would be great if we could agree, but that isn't happening. (Within the four of us in the family, two of us feel strongly in each direction. To me (a linguistic nitpicker), it has to do with the (imprecise) placement and use of the word "only" in the sentence in the rules.)
Thanks for any help.
MG

Respuesta 1:
Answered in the expansion forums:  
It's not reserved to it - you can still choose to play that color elsewhere on the row/column, but then the special space will remain empty.

Respuesta 2:
Thank you both for the question (conundrum) and the proposed answer. I love the hunt, discussion, and interpretation topics on rules, across many games. I like to dissect rules books as I am learning new games. Some are so poorly written, it seems unfathomable that anyone could have reviewed them prior to publication, let alone tested the game with them.

Back to AZUL - I might have leaned toward the condition that the coloured square blocks all other squares in that line for the colour, but I like the idea of potentially getting "painted" into a corner also. I'll have to revisit Mosaic to try this resolved interpretation out.

Original Azul: incomplete rows have no effect on scoring. They carry over to the next round, where you can complete them. Any incomplete rows at the end of the game don't score.

Summer Pavillion: There are no "rows" here, so I'm assuming you mean tiles you selected but did not place. In all rounds but the final round, you can carry up to four tiles to the next round without penalty (these are the four spaces in the corners of your board), and any additional tiles are minus one point. At game end, it's the same except you can't carry any forward, so every unplaced tile is -1.

Queen's Garden: You can carry as many tiles forward to the next round as you have spaces in your staging area. At game end, they score negative points based on the tile value (i.e. trees are -1, birds are -2...), except for joker tiles, which are +1 each.

Incomplete columns of glass panels have no effect on scoring during rounds and they carry over to the next round, and you get 1 point for every 3 left there at the end of the game.
You get to advance your player token in the broken glass track for every glass piece that you pick that you are unable to place on your panel. If you reach the bottom of the track, you lose 18 points and place your marker on the top again. When the game ends (6 rounds) you lose points equal to your position in this track.

I feel fairly confident it's reasonably possible that your game is an unauthorized "knock off". There are several red flags beyond the fact that no one has heard of it before.

Tema 40: Azul Mini Review by Alooza Boardgames
Pregunta:
Description: In Azul, players take turns selecting colored tiles from suppliers to fill their player boards. Later in the round, points are earned based on how the tiles are placed to decorate the palace. Additional points are awarded for specific patterns and completing sets, while unused supplies are deducted from the player's score. The player with the most points at the end of the game emerges victorious.

Atmosphere: Despite being a scaled-down version of Azul, it faithfully preserves the essence of the original. You still experience the satisfaction of being a tile-laying artist and crafting beautiful patterns. Moreover, the new player board includes plastic trays that securely hold your tiles in place, enhancing the overall tile-laying experience.

Art: The patterns on the tiles are mesmerizing, boasting vibrant colors. There's little to criticize about the game's art, given that one of the game's primary goals is to create your art using the tiles.

Components: The components are of outstanding quality. The linen bag, resin tiles, and player boards are meticulously crafted and sturdy. The new player board provides a more satisfying experience with its plastic tray for laying tiles as the tiles fit snugly and do not shift. The only components I wish were higher quality are the nine display mats made of very thin cartons.

Box and insert: Being a travel-size version of Azul, you have two storage options: keep everything in the original box or transfer everything to a linen bag. The game provides a plastic insert for the display mats, the most delicate components. Compared to the original Azul, the Mini version is half the size but larger than typical small game boxes.

Learn-to-play: Learning the rules of Azul is straightforward, requiring just a couple of pages from the rulebook to grasp. However, explaining the rules to all players before playing is crucial to ensure everyone comprehends the scoring system accurately. This isn't a game you can teach players during gameplay.

Gameplay: In Azul, player interaction is minimal. While you can disrupt your opponent's plans by taking the tiles they need, the focus is primarily on skillfully arranging your tiles to construct the best wall and accumulate as many points as possible. Azul can be likened to a puzzle, where each game session involves attempting to create a superior piece of art while contending with opponents striving to thwart your plans.

Replayability: Azul offers good replayability, as you must continually adapt to the available tiles and your opponents' actions. The same strategy will only sometimes be effective. However, Azul isn't a game I'd immediately wish to replay; it is a satisfying filler game.

For Whom?: Azul Mini is a must-have classic if you still need to own any Azul games in your collection. It's very compact, and the plastic player board inserts elevate the gaming experience. If you're already a fan of Azul, I recommend acquiring this game only if Azul is one of your favorites, especially if you're planning to take it on your next trip or vacation. Azul Mini is ideal if you appreciate abstract and less interactive games.

Tema 41: Have you ever seen anyone fill up almost every tile on their board?
Pregunta:
Just wondering how full you've seen an Azul board filled ?

Is it even possible to fill the whole thing up? Is this more likely in a 4 player game or a game with less players?

Just wondering ...

Respuesta 1:
It's possible, but unlikely to happen. As the game end is triggered as soon one player has finished their first row, you have only one round to fill in the last piece in each row to max out the board. So every player will have to work towards that goal instead of finishing the game in a favorable position, and even then you need the luck of the draw with your tiles.

Respuesta 2:
All but four wall spots were empty.

Respuesta 3:
I have played probably around 100 games of Azul, I have only ever seen round 7 twice, and round 6 maybe 15 times, for round 10 to occur (which would be required to fill the board) both players would have to be on 4 out of 5 tiles placed on each row, and one player would need the exact tiles to hit all 5.

So basically unless it's pre planned and setup it's essentially impossible. Round 8 is realistically as far as a game could reasonably go playing correctly.

I have played probably around 100 games of Azul, I have only ever seen round 7 twice, and round 6 maybe 15 times, for round 10 to occur (which would be required to fill the board) both players would have to be on 4 out of 5 tiles placed on each row, and one player would need the exact tiles to hit all 5.

So basically unless it's pre planned and setup it's essentially impossible. Round 8 is realistically as far as a game could reasonably go playing correctly.
While I agree that it would need to be pre-planned and setup to happen, I'm not sure where you get the requirement of at least 10 rounds to fill the board. Is there some simulation or maths that has been done get to that?

Interesting, let me have a think about this.

If either player completes a row the game ends, only one tile can be moved across per row, per round. Therefore you need enough rounds to allow 4 tiles to be full on each row, to setup the 5th tile on each row all within the same round, there are 20 of each coloured tile in the bag, and 100 tiles in total.

Assuming you were playing with 2 players, and you were trying to get one player to have a full board (Player A as will be referred to from now on), you would require the "random" distribution of tiles to be not-so-random shall we say, whereby its always possible to cycle a 5-of-a-kind per round. In addition, "Player B" must only ever pick tiles that are not required by Player A on any given round.

Player B would have to make sure that they do not take more than 5 of any colour in total over the course of 5 rounds, as player A would require 10,11,12,13,14 of each colour respectively over the course of 4 rounds to complete 4-tile rows within the placement rules allowing 1,2,3,4,5 to remain to complete the 5th tile on each row. 20 tiles come out per round in a 2 player setup, so player A would need to take an average of 3 tiles every pull and Player B would need to take only 1 tile maximum per pull.

Now it gets really complicated, because Player A does NOT want to ever end up forced to pick up 3 tiles when they cannot place them, and always wants to be able to pick up 4 or 5 when possible, so Player B would need to deliberately pick to allow a stack of 5 to build in the center at least once per round, with a deliberate quad on the initial round setup, one triple, and no doubles. You cannot have doubles because it results in Player B pulling 6 tiles prior to the end of Round 4 meaning Player A cannot possibly complete all 5 rows until a bag refill which occurs after round 5 in a 2 player setup.

As such I believe it is possible for a player to completely fill an Azul board in 6 turns, but it would have to be premeditated pulls and placement, and both players would have to deliberately pick to allow Player A to play with 100% placement efficiency.

We played with 3 players and my board had 3 pieces missing at the end.

Tema 42: Has Azul earned its place? | Azul Review
Pregunta:
Some Information:
Designed by Michael Kiesling
Published by Next Move Games / Plan B Games
Published in 2017

Azul is number 73 on the BGG Top 100. The Top 100 is, supposedly, the absolute pinnacle of gaming. The best you can get from the many thousands of games released every year. As determined by the large BGG user base. And, I think this belongs in its place. I've played Azul 32 times, as of 10/29/2023, and it is always a delight.

In Azul, you are ceramic artists decorating the walls of a Portuguese palace. Of course, this is more of an abstract game. The theme isn't really prevalent. The tiles are pretty, and they kind of look like Starbursts, but the theme just doesn't hold.

The mechanics are where this game shines. In Azul, you draft tiles from a central ring of locations, picking all the ones of the same color from a "supplier" and placing them in one row on your player board. Not only is that mechanic thinky in its own right but the rest of the tiles from that location get pushed into the central area, which, eventually, becomes a mish-mash of colors that no one wants, steadily accumulating until someone bites the bullet and decides to take them. So, while this game can definitely be played only by staring at your board and the combinations that would make a good round, you always have to keep an eye on others' boards, so that you don't contribute to the steadily growing pile in the center. Because the round only ends once all tiles are taken from the suppliers and the central area.

Every turn, you'll find yourself peering over at your opponents, trying to calculate what tiles they are most likely to take so that you can reorder your priorities accordingly. But then, they throw a wrench into your plans by taking the exact opposite of what you thought they were going for. So, you either have to pivot dramatically in order to get things done on your board, or you'll end up having a largely uneventful turn, while your opponents pull ahead.

What I'm trying (and potentially failing) to say with the above paragraphs is that Azul is deceptively complex in nature. While the game itself and the actions you take are simple, the thought processes behind all of your potential turns have roots that will run from the beginning of the game all the way to the end. One of the best feelings in tabletop gaming is being able to look down and see the path you chose. Such as seeing the catalysts that caused you to change strategy too many rounds in, and see why that didn't work. Azul has that in spades.

Having spoken about the gameplay, let's move on to components. And, I'm going to say that it is a mixed bag. While the tiles are a lovely material that provides a tactile experience, the player boards could be better. They are cardboard, but the scoring cubes can slide off easily, causing you to lose your spot score-wise. Not only that, but we've noticed that our copy's player boards are starting to wear down. Of course, this is one of our highest-played games, so maybe that plays into it, but we do seem to have that issue.

Another possible negative for this game is that it can be mean. Especially in 2-player games of Azul, hate drafting can become an issue, whereby you and your opponent are borderline incentivized to take the tiles that mess your opponent up, simply because no one else can win. If you mess up your opponent, they lose points, you gain points, and there is no other opponent to rocket ahead while you are squabbling. Hate drafting can be prevalent, but it also all depends on who you are playing the game with. Personally, I don't think this is a terrible thing, but it has definitely made the people I've played this game with change their opinions of it.

Finally, the final "possible" negative (and another one I don't really care about) is the theme or lack thereof. You supposedly play as artisans bedazzling the walls of the Portuguese King's palace. And while the tiles are pretty, the theme isn't really there, and it just boils down to "pick up pretty tiles to arrange them in pretty patterns to score points." Again, I have no gripe with this, and my love of a game does not directly stem from a good theme. It certainly can help though (such as my personal favorite game, TI4, which probably wouldn't have ranked 1st without that space theme).

Azul is a modern classic. There isn't any debating that. And, personally, I think it's a great piece of design from a great designer. So, I think it's a great game. Enough said.

So, if I'm understanding this comment correctly, when my action denies points to my opponent while gaining me points, that's called hate drafting? Among the gamers I play with, we consider that the objective of the game.

Respuesta 4:
I'm glad that mechanic works for you and your table!

But I do know that some people will be personally opposed to that and would rather not deal with it as a potential strategy. I personally don't mind it very much, but I know that some will. For example, a family member absolutely hates this and refuses to play 2p games of Azul, simply because of that potential.

Two-player is the most common setting in our house. Hate drafting doesn't happen.

I may differ with you about what constitutes hate drafting. If I might knowingly try to disrupt my opponent, that is not automatically hate drafting; it's normal (and useful).

Alternatively, if I, myself, sacrifice an opportunity to gain much better points in the action - that's likely hate drafting.

(but even then, not necessarily so - Hate Drafting is being purposely disruptive, rather than thoughtfully competitive)

Respuesta 6:
Of course, actual hate drafting is an edge case here, but getting in each others' way is definitely more prevalent and encouraged in Azul than in other games.

I simply wanted to point that out because it has ruined a few games of Azul here and there, I certainly don't want that to be a surprise if someone buys the game without knowing that potential. But on the whole, I do think this game is absolutely stellar.

Thank you for the feedback and clarification, I totally agree with your sentiment.

At 2p, not allowing the opponent to win means allowing oneself to win, which in turn means that the hate drafter did not really sacrifice their points, so they are not actually a hate drafter?

I mostly play coops or multiplayer solitaire games, as I don’t enjoy competing with others in board games. I came looking to see whether Azul would have this kind of interaction at two players, so thank you for flagging that. I don’t know what folks are on about above. Your description is quite clear: if you don’t have a tile that’s good for you, you can take a tile that’s good for the other player (since their having fewer points is the same as you having more points). I would call this “hate drafting” in the sense that I’m drafting something to prevent you from gaining points, rather than to gain points myself.

My only nitpick with this is that in your scenario, Player A has no options for positive points. So (presumably) the remaining options pathway is 'Take less negative than my opponent'. I wouldn't call that specific scenario 'hate-drafting' personally, but I'd accept that as the line someone draws.

I absolutely agree with the sentiment that Azul (especially at 2) can facilitate hate drafting. I've rarely seen a player forgo positive points in favour of net position, but that's more a statement of the people I play with than the game itself.

"Take the blue to prevent the next player scoring 10 for a set of 5."

All players, no watchers.
What if it was a tournament?
It's hard to know whether you're serious? Primarily because it's not a rules question but one of good gaming etiquette.
As others have pointed out, your etiquette is spot on if the next player is you and you're helping a new player or playing a primarily friendly game. But, "What if it was a tournament?" changes things completely.

In a tournament setting I'd suggest good etiquette would only permit this in a 2 player game because (a) you're the next player and (b) no-one else is affected, even indirectly, by your assistance.

As for the rules they make no mention of this as it's not a negotiation game any more than it's a contact sport. (I'm sure of the latter because they make no mention of shoulder barging or biting either.)

What was the context that prompted your question?

Respuesta 5:
I say it's inappropriate, even in casual play.

It’s nice to help beginners (if the player being advised was a beginner), but in general they need to learn a game for themselves.

Additionally, the motivation for a player to give such advice is, well, questionable. The current player may have less interest in nobbling the next player than in, say, taking a set of tiles which would otherwise benefit the adviser. Besides, taking a ten point bonus from an opponent doesn’t necessarily equate to ones best move.

Respuesta 6:
Entirely depends on the group and their attitude to table talk.

Respuesta 7:
I feel like most of the consideration here is “is it fair on the player who could’ve taken the tile to complete their set?” but I have another take which is “is it fair on the player who didn’t ask for your advice?”

I usually don’t like getting unsolicited advice because I want to feel like I’m playing my own game, under my own steam. If I saw the move already and take it, the targeted player is annoyed about the “collaboration”. If I don’t take it, you’re annoyed that it’s to snub you and I’m now a kingmaker.

Basically… it’s my turn, let me play it.

As Matthew says, some cryptic comment might be appropriate depending on how far away it is from “this is the move I want you to make” - nothing much more than “player X is doing pretty well, eh?”

Respuesta 8:
I'd have to say it depends on the group. My regular group does this kind of thing all the time. I wouldn't do it with a pick-up group at a con or anything.

Respuesta 9:
The Enemy of my Enemy is my Friend. All's fair in Board Gaming.

Respuesta 10:
It's not "cheating" as there are no rules against it, but as others have said, I would really question whether this is acceptable table etiquette. A lot would depend on your gaming group and other variables but, in general, I would agree that this would, usually, not be acceptable behavior, but that's just me and my group. Now, roasting the player for not making that move, after the fact, is wholly acceptable, and even encouraged, in my group.

Respuesta 11:

Is it absolute bullshittery? Yes.

Respuesta 12:

Respuesta 14:
Among friends we do this all the time.

It's like misdirection.

If there's a piece you specifically want, you point out how appealing another piece might be, or how another piece might screw over someone else, to make it more appealing to the current player. Then the player who would be screwed over by that play laughs and points out how this *other* piece would be better because it affects you, or something similar.

It's up to the current player to decide which "argument" holds water, if any.

It's all part of the game.

But as many have stated, I would not do it with strangers or for "serious" play (which I'd never take part in).

Or maybe a version of Azul for vision-impaired (blind) people, so that they can feel the colours of the tiles. Perhaps each tile has Braille on it or has a different raised symbol on it. I think it would be cool to play this with one's eyes closed. Perhaps for extra difficulty, they can introduce a memory mechanic - for example, something like each player is only allowed to feel an opponent's game board once every two rounds ... which means that one has to remember the tiles that the opponent has placed?

Hello. I recently bought my copy of Azul, after playing it at a board game store. What worries me a little is that the tiles in the store copy were already very worn from use, losing the beautiful patterns they have printed on them. So, does anyone know if there is a way to protect the tiles so that the patterns don't rub off?
Hi Gerson and welcome to BGG. Fortunately not everyone here is as unwelcoming as Paul has chosen to be.

I can't help directly with your question I'm afraid but I'm pretty sure someone will make a useful suggestion soon.

Yes - support the makers of the game and buy another one when they get to be too worn.

Good point, my levity got missed in the text. Perhaps ending it with a question mark might have helped too.

These games of ours are made to be played with, which brings with it some risks such as wear and tear. Some of that can be mitigated such as by sleeving cards in clear plastic sleeves. Other things that can be done are to use a spray lacquer to help protect, but that tends to cause problems when the items are being handled frequently as is the case with Azul tiles.

One of the risks of applying too much protection is that they end up becoming like those Star Wars toys, that are forever boxed up and not used in fear of them losing some value.

I know of some games that have had to be "retired from service" due to excessive wear and use. Mysterium is a good example as the tokens tend to get worn away by tense players handling them.

When a game has been fondly played and enjoyed for many years, I have no problem at all parting with $50 for a new version of it to restore it back to new, because it's not a risky purchase. I know that I've enjoyed the older version of the game for a long time, and will have many more years to come with the new version of that game. The old one can even make it to a second-hand store or similar community area where others might find as much enjoyment from it too.

I get the point Paul was trying to make. Games should be played. They aren’t works of art to be gazed at from a distance and not touched. However, with that being stated, personally, I never assume people have the money to go buy a new copy. Not everyone has the same financial means and I support people that want to take care of some thing, protect it, fix it or repair it, rather than throwing it away and buying something new.

Gerson I am curious, did you buy the store copy with all the wear, or some other copy? I ask because games that see public communal play, like ones at a bar or gaming club, likely see way more plays than a normal person would get out of their game and people don’t always take care of things that aren’t theirs. And it may be the tiles got dirty or sticky or gross and so someone washed them over and over. So I imagine yours would stay in good shape if it doesn’t already have the damage. With that being said, I don’t have a knowledgeable answer to your question. I would guess you could protect it with some kind of clear enamel spray, or some thing of the sort, but then I would worry it would get sticky. I don’t know if I would risk it. I would at least test it on just one or two before I did all of them.

Hi Gerson, welcome to BGG!

You can buy clear paint that works reasonably well to essentially "laminate" acrylic tiles, BUT you need to be super careful that you don't over-do it as it can make the tiles kind of "sticky"/"rubbery" in feel if you apply it too thick. You can also get it in pot form and could paint it on with a brush as opposed to a spray but I would not recommend it.

All this being said, I would say that the cost of the paint would be £12-£15 or equivalent, you have no guarantee of being able to effectively coat the tiles evenly and even then the paint will come off over time relatively quickly (say within 30 plays). It probably is just a better idea to just buy a new copy of Azul, which I would imagine you could find for around £30 or equivalent and I would recommend you do this.

Also also, your copy of Azul must of been played a LOT for it to be in that condition, I mean literally hundreds and hundreds of plays, we have played Azul probably about 80 times and the tiles still look brand new.

Hi Paul, I see your point. I'm relatively new to this world of board games, and reading the answers I think I should have first asked how quickly the Azul tiles wear out, which apparently last a long time in good condition. So maybe by then I'd be willing to buy a new copy. Thanks for the reply.

About 150 plays in, you might notice some wear. After 600 plays, the designs will completely be gone on most of the tiles. It has been sad to see.

I have considered buying a second copy, but only because I want to try playing with eight players at some point. It is possible, with enough tiles and factories.

Respuesta 10:
My roommates and I play fairly often and the tiles are holding up perfectly. I’m not sure if this will further extend the the life of our times but it seems like it could. But we keep a small collapsible bowl in the box. One of those silicon ones that fold flat and pop up usually marketed as travel water bowls for cats or small dogs. We use it for the discard tiles because we got sick of fishing them out of the corners of the box lid and can instead just pour them back into the bag. So potentially the decreased amount of sliding around in the box lid and occasionally falling onto the floor in an impatient attempt to pour them from the lid into the bag could increase their longevity somewhat

Respuesta 11:
I have covered my azul mini tiles with some transparent nail polish.
You have to be careful when "painting them" because too much nail polish can make the pieces feel uneven, is better to top them with a slim coat, let them aside for 24 hours and if you feel they need a second coat, do it after they are completely dry.

I'm so glad you started this thread. I really really would like to keep the print on my pieces preserved for as long as possible and have even considered spraying Krylon Triple Thick Glaze on it, but was not sure whether it would affect it the pieces negatively.

I just received my copy and I already have two tiles that look like this:


One of them looks like there was a problem with the printing process (black), but the other looks like it was subject to a scratch (teal).

Whether 150 plays or 600+ plays, if acrylic glaze can preserve the print so that it stays visible for longer, I wouldn't hesitate to do it. But like I said, I don't know what the chances are that it will mess up the pieces. I've read accounts that it can create a sticky feel on certain surfaces and if that happened to my pieces, I would be crestfallen.

Krylon recommends trying it out on a small extraneous sample of the material, but it's not like the game comes with extra replacement tiles or anything. This looks like something for which I'd have to jump all in to keep the pieces uniform. I'm pretty sure if I sprayed only some of the pieces that it would affect the uniformity, so that is a no-go. Has anybody tried this? Am I the only one who wants to experiment with acrylic glaze on the pieces?

Edit: btw, thank you all in advance for any thoughts and suggestions on the matter

Consider;
How much does the acrylic glaze cost?
How much of it would you need?
How much of your time would it take to apply?
What are the chances that the end result would be bad or a waste of time?

Respuesta 14:
150 plays out of a game is money very well spent. I would be perfectly fine to get a new copy after that time, if I still want to play it. The cost would probably still be lower than trying to preserve the tiles using home methods.

I echo this basically, I am a big fan of improving games like painting components or making your own inserts etc as long as it's a game you love and you enjoy a bit of crafting, also you get the bonus of having a unique personal copy of a game, but for Azul which is widely available for around £25 or equivalent when it gets to the point that it's knackered I would honestly just say buy a new copy, then donate your old one to a charity shop or local games store for people to enjoy. If you got 100 games out of it and you normally play with 2 players, it's cost you 13 pence a game - well worth it I think all will agree.

Consider; ...
How much does the acrylic glaze cost?
$6.47 USD / €6.03 EURO per can (I already own a can of acrylic spray that I'm using for my PnP version of The Duke)

How much of it would you need?
Just one or two coats; definitely not more than three. Coverage of one can is about 20 ft² or 1.8581m² per can.

How much of your time would it take to apply?
Just a few seconds per pass with no more than two or three passes within the hour. Probably not more than 5 seconds per pass, or 15 seconds total.

What are the chances that the end result would be bad or a waste of time?
That's the unknown. I've done a lot of research and it should just be fine, but was wondering if anyone here has already tried it. I could just look at the pieces I've already sprayed for The Duke (it's probably dried by now) but it's technically wood and not plastic. Can says wood and plastic are both fine.

That's a fair point. It's good that you bring up making your own inserts, because that's probably the area where I can save the most money for this hobby. I don't dislike crafting, but making inserts seems incredibly labor-intensive to me. I'm okay with gluing punch-outs together, but it's the designing, measuring, planning, (basically the conception) process that I find intimidating. The first part of the process seems to take a lot of cognitive effort.

In my situation, I already have a can of acrylic glaze spray within easy reach so I was more wondering if anyone had tried it with either good or bad results. In my situation, one or two spray passes over all of the pieces is just a few seconds and is 'child's play' compared to something like making an insert (I clearly find this daunting).

I've already been considering materials for making a few PnP versions of certain games (such as Hive) because of the retail version's cost. I'm on unemployment for now, but I don't want to give up on one of the only things that bring me joy (boardgaming), so I'm trying to save where I can and take steps to preserve what I own (I also sleeve cards almost compulsively).

Thank you all for your input.



Tema 48: Azul mini review: Shrinkage gone right
Pregunta:
Every board game enthusiast has faced this issue at some point. The desire to take boardgames on the road with you so you can play while traveling. But the practicality of packing favorite games becomes a genuine challenge. Luggage space, as we all know, is a premium commodity.

Behold Azul Mini. A response, perhaps, to the cries of travelers who yearn to play board games away from home. What @next_move_games has accomplished with Azul Mini isn't just mere shrinkage. It’s designed with portability in mind.



The tiles, though smaller, boast a clever design. There are grooves on the bottom of the tiles. Paired with the newly designed player board, which features subtle yet game-changing bumps, these tiles find their snug fit. Gone are the days when a slight jostle or a turbulent flight causes your entire game to fly all over the place. Even the score track was changed to address this issue.




However, let's not forget the original Azul. Those chunky tiles that feel oh so nice to hold and place. Their heft, combined with the game's visual appeal, makes it a centerpiece of many gaming nights. If your travels are few and far between, the full-sized Azul is definitely the better choice.




But, if wanderlust frequently takes hold and you find yourself gaming in airport lounges, campfires, or cozy hotel lobbies, then Azul Mini might just be your new best friend. Ingeniously compact, it's a testament to the fact that sometimes, big joys do come in small packages.

The Good
Acrylic tiles with grooves
Scoring Track
Player boards with bumps
Large travel bag

The Not So Good

Respuesta 3:
By only gripe is the bag. It doesn’t close well enough due to only a single metal snap. It’s also way too big to really serve as a draw bag for the smaller size tiles. You need to at least double bag the tiles or you are going to end up losing some of them. I keep the set in the box and use a smaller dice bag that fits in the box bag to hold the tiles during play. I don’t use the included bag at all.

I 3d printed a container to slide into the bag to keep things a little tidy but I use a baggy for the tiles. I like the extra large bag for the tiny tiles. Lol

Tema 49: Do Azul Mini Rules Apply to Standard Size Azul?
Pregunta:
The rules seem the same but with some clarifications. Specifically, some play the original rules to mean that IF a pattern line is open, one may NOT add tiles to the floor line until pattern lines are filled. However, in Azul Mini rules, that point is cleared up to allow a player to play tiles anyplace according to placement rules.

Thanks for help.

You might be drafting something that an opponent wants, OR the options available are not what you want, and you don't want to tie up a line with a colour you don't really want. So you take the hit and drop them to the floor so you can keep a particular line open for next round.

I have the original printing (cardboard start token) of Azul. It is clear to me in the rules of that edition that you may place the tiles you pick up to the floor at any time. It does not matter if you have rows open or not.
Thematically: Oops clumsy tiler!

I suspect that Azul mini have simply explicitly clarified that point rather than revising the rules.

Thanks everyone! It seemed pretty clear, but another player was hung up on the first instruction to place tiles in one of the pattern lines according to rules.



Tema 50: Our review of Azul Mini (Portuguese Review)Edit
Pregunta:
O jogo Azul estava na nossa lista de desejados. Quando vimos a versão Mini, não resistimos. Para mais numa época de férias, esta versão é muito mais fácil de transportar e diversão garantida.

Embora a caixa exterior seja um pouco frágil, os seus componentes estão bastante bem estruturados e têm uma óptima jogabilidade. Se alguma crítica temos a fazer, em termos das peças que o constituem, prende-se apenas com o plástico utilizado para os tabuleiros individuais de jogo, que poderiam ser mais transparentes, tornando a imagem mais nítida.

Quanto ao jogo em si, Azul desafia os jogadores a construir uma parede de azulejos. Mas não de uma forma qualquer... o jogo dá o local onde cada azulejo deve ser colocado e em cada ronda, importa recolher os azulejos certos para otimizar os pontos obtidos. Temos ainda pontos extra por cada coluna construída, bem como por completar uma cor. Ganha quem construir a primeira linha.

É um jogo simples, que se aprende com muita facilidade, ideal para todas as idades, mas que requer atenção e antecipação de jogadas, caso contrário ficaremos com azulejos que não encaixam e que se tornam pontos negativos...

O tabuleiro de jogo tem ainda dois lados. O lado "B", não impõe as cores, mas as regras são as mesmas, não podem haver cores repetidas nem em linha, nem em coluna. Temos jogado muito este jogo em família, porque cada partida é relativamente pequena, com jogadas rápidas que criam dinamismo.



Tema 51: Missing Scoring Markers in New Purchase
Pregunta:
We recently purchased the game from Amazon in the US, and our copy is missing the four scoring markers. Is this a known issue that others have come across?

Respuesta 1:
No, not a known issue. See if you can get new cubes from the publisher, or a replacement game from Amazon.

Respuesta 2:
Azul is published by Next Move Games which is part of Plan B Games which is owned by Asmodee. (https://corporate.asmodee.com/news/asmodee-acquires-plan-b-g...)

Asmodee no longer supports parts replacement in the US (https://www.asmodeena.com/en/customer-service-faq/). Instead, you have to return the full game to the retailer and get a new one.

Respuesta 3:
A faulty product, return to Amazon and ask for a replacement.

Respuesta 4:
I would imagine you need a full product swapout, which is a bit of a pain in the ass, particularly via Amazon.

Score Markers in Azul are just 4x Acrylic 8mmx8mm cubes though, so assumedly you would have some spares from another game maybe? (Used in many, many games so you might already have them if you think about it).

Tema 52: Cooperative Mode: The Tile Guild
Pregunta:
Hi Everybody!
I came up with a cooperative mode for Azul I'm calling "The Tile Guild."
Here are the full rules.
Here is the rules video.

OBJECTIVE
The King has grown tired of your incomplete walls and has threatened to close down all the tile factories. He will close one factory each round. Your goal is use your prestige points to re-open all the factories so that you have the same number of open factories as you had at the beginning of the game.

SETUP
Remove the player one tile (you will not use it)
Setup like normal. Be sure to setup the right number of factories for the number of players you have:
2 Players - 5 Factories
3 Players - 7 Factories
4 Players - 9 Factories

HOW TO PLAY

Tiles
Take and place tiles like normal when you take them from a factory.
When you take tiles from the center area, you must take all the tiles from the center area, but you can only place one matching set on a pattern line, the rest must go on your floor line.
At the end of each round, total up your points like normal.

Factories
After you total you points, remove one factory.
Then, a player may spend ten prestige points to reopen a factory. You can re-open as many factories as you have prestige points to pay for, but players cannot combine points, they can only use the points they have.
NOTE: If it’s your turn to take tiles, but you have nowhere to place them, add them to your floor line. If your floor is full, just discard them.

HOW TO WIN
Your goal is re-open all the factories so that you have the same number of open factories as you had at the begining of the game.

I hope you enjoy! Please leave a comment if you end up playing it or have any questions or suggestions!
Here's a Geeklist of all the games I have may variants for.

Respuesta 1:
Very interesting rule!

At the end of the round, can only one player redeem points for a factory, or more than one? Of course, if each of them has 10 points independently.

Respuesta 2:
Yes, multiple players can spend points. So if you and I were playing together, you could spend ten of your points to reopen a factory and I could spend ten of mine!



Tema 53: Pretty
Pregunta:
Azul, on first play, felt lighter than I expected due to the quick game play, but also slightly heavier than expected due to the multiple point scoring strategies. I guess I should have read the point scoring more carefully before I started playing. I was hoping for a light competitive game that would satisfy an audience that isn’t looking for anything even close to a take-that feeling. Azul started to feel like that, but also, it seems that there are some take-that opportunities to force opponents to have penalties from tiles on their floor. I can imagine that being an important consideration in what tiles you leave in the center.
The box art and typography is beautiful. The tactile feel and solid look of the tiles is very satisfying.

Respuesta 1:
I think you just described it beautifully. The gameplay can be mild, but there are depths to the decisions for the strategy gamers at the table. Casual gamers can sort of be playing a different game at the same time they are playing with strategy gamers.

Respuesta 2:
At two player, this is absolutely a take that game. If you want to be competitive, you’d better be mean. I won’t hesitate to draft a single tile directly to my penalty row simply to keep my opponent from scoring that round.

Original prints were black wooden scoring cubes and a cardboard player one token.

All prints since then are black acrylic scoring cubes and an actual "1st player" tile instead.



Tema 55: Yet another simple botless solo variant to kick the tires and learn the game
Pregunta:
Goal here was to actually play through and see how game works. Keep it simple, stick as close to the original rules, no bots. In short, a walk through version. Here is my take. Keep other things the same, except:
* do not use 1 tile to signify 1st player
* 3 factory disks (in keeping with the logic of reduced number of disks. 4 tiles per disk.
* each turn take set of matching color tiled and slide into middle of play area tiles not grabbed.
* once all 3 factory disks are emptied above, player takes one color set of same color tiles from middle. Rest are removed, but may recycle later if bag is empty.
* continue until reach end game conditions. Play to get as high of a score as possible.

Purpose is to get person using it acclimated to enough of game to play it later with other people and teach it.

At the end of the game, I keep whichever score is the lowest as a beat-your-own-score type game. That gives me incentive to make both boards as good as possible.
Clever idea.

The analogy I thought of was Between Two Castles of Mad King Ludwig, a competitive game where you build two castles, one with each opponent sitting next to you. Your score is your lowest castle.

Tema 56: Who has the next go?
Pregunta:
The first to go in each round is whoever took the [1] tile in the previous round

Respuesta 1:
This is what the white "starting player marker" with "1" on it is for!

During a round, the first player to take a pile from the center of the table gets the starting player marker.
When the next round starts, whoever holder the first player token will become the new first player - then, you return the starting player marker to the center of the table.

Respuesta 2:
Don't forget that the first player marker also counts as a broken tile at the end of the round so will also factor in as negative points - very important when deciding if you want to take from the middle or not.

Indeed. I would say that the rules as quoted below (with my highlight) are not truly explicit. They require players to understand by inference.
Quote:
C. Preparing the next round
If nobody has completed a horizontal line of 5 consecutive tiles
on her wall yet (see End of the game), prepare the next round.
The player with the starting player marker refills each of the
Factory displays with 4 tiles from the bag as in the setup. If the
bag is empty, refill it with all the tiles that you have placed in
the lid of the game box and then continue filling the remaining
Factory displays. Then, start the new round.

Tema 57: Azul Mini - One of the least fun dexterity games out there.
Pregunta:
I've been wanting to play Azul for a while but did not want to pull the trigger as I didn't know if it would go over well with my wife and our gaming partners. When I went to my FLGS and saw that a mini version was out for only $19.99, I figured I'd take the plunge.

The game went over really well with everyone so I was happy I bought it. However, we were playing on the back deck Saturday night and one of the pieces fell off the table. Watched it fall, watched it hit the deck, had time to think "I hope that doesn't fall through one of the cracks", and then watched it fall through one of the cracks.

My deck is about two feet above the ground and has really no way to crawl under (unless you are a possum.) I got a flashlight and looked between the cracks and could see the piece - luckily(?) it was one of the yellow ones.

So, the plan was to get a wire hanger, put some tape on it, and pull the tile back up through the crack it fell through. First roadblock, much like Joan Crawford's, our house has no wire hangers. No problem, I have a few spools of electrical wire in the garage.

I cut off a piece of wire, affixed the tape, and attempted to “snag” the tile. It worked pretty well and I proceeded to pull up the wire. After a foot of movement, the tile fell off and returned to the ground.

Of course it did not fall straight down and it took a while looking through other cracks to find again. Once found, I thought ahead (nice time to do that) and figured even if I snagged it, it would be on the larger surface which would not fit back up through the crack (it turned “sideways” when originally through the crack.)

Time to put my grade school engineering degree to work. I had a large roll of brown paper in the garage. I cut off about a five-foot long piece and folded about three inches of each side of the long edge of the paper into the middle. Then, I folded the piece in half on the short edge to create a sort of envelope. This was put folded edge down into the closest crack.

Since the tape did not work well, I put a dab of silicone caulking on the end of the wire and went after the tile again. Being careful not to touch the ground with the end, I was able to “glob” the tile. I then moved the wire with tile sideways so that it was in the paper envelope.

My son then pulled up the envelope GENTLY. The best success of the mission followed as the tile automatically turned sideways as it came up through the crack and a quick cleanse of the tile followed. We were back in business and then finished the game in the house.

Overall I think this will be hitting the table fairly often. It will not be hitting the deck anytime soon.

It's to show that these tiles are placed already, that's why the colours are more vibrant (r2c3 and r3c4). Rows 1, 4 and 5 don't have yellow tiles

Respuesta 6:
What happens here is that in lines 2 and 3 you already placed that yellow tile. Line 4 is occupied by blue tiles so you only have line 1 and 5 to place those two yellow tiles

Yeah, the picture could probably have made more of a distinction - or circled them in something other than background-white!

I will try and let you know the outcome

Respuesta 3:
What should work is a little arithmetic.
The designer on Thingiverse (Thomaswt) says his design fits a board 24x24cm. So measure your board (in cm to make it easier)
Say yours is 25.92x25.92.

25.92/24 = 1.08 So scale your print by 108% in the X and Y dimension. Leave the Z dimension unchanged so the height does not change.

Of course, use your actual dimensions not my made up ones.

AND print a calibration cube first to make sure your printer is accurate before you start. You may need to adjust the calibration on your printer. There should be an adjustment in the advanced settings, I know mine was off slightly which meant my first attempt at Scythe containers did not fit in the box. Something I blamed on the model for the longest time until I got more savvy with my printer.

All bets are off if Thomaswt's printer was not calibrated properly. Which is quite possible.

I tried scaling it up a bit and it seems the issue with that is it does not line up with the scoring section. The whole reason I tried this was because the scoring cube did not fit into the overlay. So the original design looks like the overlay fits the spaces correctly but it does not hold the cube. I think what I might have to do is just substitute some other cubes from a different game. It would be too difficult to shave off a little bit from each section as it would affect the stability of the 3d model.

So it sounds like the problem is that the cube size has changed, not the board. An easier option might be to sand the cubes a bit, but then you would have to repaint them. Subbing in a cube from a different game sounds like the best option, but that leaves that game short four cubes.

Personally what we did was replace the scoring cubes with  . We quite like that the tiles slide right off when it is time to remove them. An overlay that locks them in place sounds like a pain. A bump big enough to dislodge the tiles significantly is very rare in our household. Though it has happened. The scoring cubes though



Tema 60: 2-Player Lessons From My Rise to Expert Rank
Pregunta:
i had started playing Azul just as a nice simple diversion when i didn't feel like going hard in It's a Wonderful World or Castles of Burgundy, and was surprised at how much meat there is to this game. There aren't any of those wacky combos/synergies that let you score 9843598712 VP in one turn like a lot of Euros offer, but there is a lot of room for refinement in the few options you do have! This post will assume you've gone through the guides that have already been made by such fine folks as No Wonders & Alexey on Youtube; what i'm posting here are things i didn't necessarily get from standard guides that allowed me to break 500 elo on BGA. Without further ado...

Plan to build a specific column at the start, and figure out which column your opponent will most likely build!

This one is very, very important. A common trap among even above-average players is focusing heavily on the first 3 lines, since on paper those are the most efficient for scoring. However, columns are a very good deal points-wise and can allow you to deny many valuable tiles from your opponent in the process of building them!

If your opponent went first, think of the column that fits best with where they placed their initial set of tiles. You should then figure out a column you can build that will use many of the same tiles they want! One key point here is that you generally should not try to build the same column as your opponent.

As someone who was originally a fighting-game player, i like to think of this in terms of "matchups". For example, if your opponent starts the game by placing 3 blues in line 3, and there are at least a decent amount of whites & blacks available, you can expect them to play for that middle column. Thus, you should aim to build the column just to the left of the middle since that also demands a large amount of whites & blacks; this means you will naturally make strong denial plays against them in the course of building your own column. A good general rule is that the column just to the left of your opponent's is a strong "counter" to their column. The main exception is if they build the 2nd column from the left, in which case i'd prefer going for the middle column; i tend to stay away from building the columns on the far left & far right since you'll score quite a bit less from adjacency bonuses. In my view, you need very strong tile groupings dumped in your lap to consider the far left or far right columns.

If you go first, look at the largest tile groupings available and think of the columns where they fit best. One very important point here is that you should basically never start the game by placing 3 reds or 3 blacks in line 3! That's very weak for adjacency bonuses if that line 3 won't be part of your column. Instead, you should look for a good fit in line 4 or 5 for those particular groupings; for red, i pretty much always put a group of 3 in line 5 and plan on building that column regardless of the other tiles available in Round 1. The other colors are more flexible re: where you can place large groups of them, but you should still look to build a column using a group of 3 or 4 if you get to open with one.

As part of this, you should also look to take larger groupings that fit your column (especially if your opponent also needs those for their column) instead of going out of your way to finish a line (usually line 3) that doesn't fit your column. As you put groups of 2 in lines 4 & 5, you'll be surprised how often your opponent gives you a grouping that instantly fills up line 3 for you! Even if that doesn't happen, it's OK to only finish lines 1 & 2 in Round 1 if you manage to place a significant number of tiles that fit your column into the other lines; this should set you up to finish two of those lines the next round, or one of them to go with the first 3 lines.

First-player tile? Kinda overrated...

Here's another thing that separates the masters from the above-average players (or even the experts, sometimes). Most advice for beginners says to heavily prioritize the first-player tile, but if you study the very best players on BGA you'll be shocked at how rarely they grab it! If there's no strong play you can make to build your column and/or deny tiles from your opponent's column while taking the first-player tile, and there are such strong plays available elsewhere, you want to make those other strong plays and let your opponent sacrifice valuable tempo + 1-2 points to go first.

That said, if you are going first in a round and there are no urgent needs for your column among the groupings, you do want to make it less attractive for your opponent to take the first-player tile right away. If they do something else on their turn, that creates a much higher chance of a worthwhile move that lets you snag first player. So don't leave a 2+ tile grouping they need in the middle for no reason!

The biggest exception to this rule is in Round 4, as Round 5 is usually the last round and it becomes much more valuable to have first-player advantage there. Even in this case, the best players don't go nearly as hard for that tile as the average person does, but they will use it much more often than they do in other rounds. Be more willing to accept a decent move to go first in this case, but if there are only bad moves available with the first-player tile you should still strongly consider your other options.

Don't let them finish part of their column in a round if you can avoid it, but don't autopilot other denial plays

At the start of the round, you'll want to take stock of the number of tiles in your opponent's key colors. If you can use those titles to finish a line yourself and deny them a completion, you often want to do this and leave them stuck with a partially-finished line for the next round. Part of the reason for this will be explained in my last section, but it's just good for scoring. In particular, if they finish line 5 for a column but you can deny them line 3 or 4, that will cost them a good chunk in the adjacency bonus!

However, one common mistake i see among players in the 300s-400s in BGA elo is going too far out of their way to deny completion of an opponent's line that doesn't fit their column. This usually happens with line 3, e.g. if they have 2 reds placed there and you can take away the 1 remaining red tile in the round. If they won't get a good adjacency bonus from finishing that line, it can be better to focus on your own column instead. This is especially true if this kind of denial play would require you to place tiles in your floor line. Speaking of which...

Look for opportunities to force tiles into your opponent's floor line!

This is one of the most difficult skills discussed here, but definitely one of the keys to Expert & Master ranks on BGA. One of the easier pieces of advice to follow in this area is to avoid finishing a round with multiple almost-finished lines; about the only time i'm OK with this is in Round 1 if those lines are all part of your column. Ending a round with just 1 tile in line 4 is much less dangerous than ending it with 3 tiles in that same line, though having 3 is perfectly fine if you don't have another line in a similar state. The fewer emptied lines you have available for the next round, the more vulnerable you will be to a 6-8 point loss in your floor line!

One important conclusion to draw from this is that if you have a 2-tile grouping you can use to finish either line 2 or line 5, finishing line 5 is the safer play even if you risk not finishing line 2 at all for that round. It's much easier to play around an empty line 2 than a partially-finished line 5 when it comes to managing the floor line. This is also why i said above that you really want to prevent your opponent from finishing a line needed for their column, as that will leave them more vulnerable to this kind of situation.

Another thing to consider as part of this is to avoid finishing the same color in the first 3 lines too quickly (i.e. in Round 1-2). This significantly hampers your flexibility in using that color later on, particularly with a color like gold that's less useful in line 4/5. If you have a choice between two different colors to finish the same line early on, you might want to consider this aspect!

One other critical note i'll leave on this is to be very careful when considering your last couple moves of the round, if there's a big group that could end up in someone's floor line. If there is only one dish left with tiles in it, you'll want to imagine what happens after you take each possible color from that dish. The major point to understand here is that if you can guarantee an odd number of moves will remain after your turn, that means you'll avoid the least desirable color group resulting from your move! Taking different colors from the same dish, in this scenario, can leave the round with either 3 or 4 total remaining moves, and that small detail can make all the difference in who gets forced into a big floor-line move.

Also, if you can place a group of tiles in your line 3 but said group will give no or a low adjacency bonus, and your opponent has no place to use them, you should really look for a way to make your opponent eat those tiles in their floor line instead! This is another thing i often see "Strong" players on BGA miss.

If you look at players like QueenDong & Sapperlot on BGA, particularly in games against other players rated 500+, you'll be surprised how often they win while completing fewer total lines than their opponent. That's the power of the floor line!



Tema 61: Solo Mode (no AI bot): The Angry King
Pregunta:
Here is my take on a solo mode for Azul that I am calling "The Angry King." The King is tired of partially tiled walls littering his palace and demands you build a fully tiled wall or he will close down all the tile factories.

Video Here: Azul Solo Mode: The Angry King

SETUP
Game Board
5 Factories

TAKING TILES
Whenever you take tiles from a factory, move the remaining tiles clockwise into the next factory that has tiles in it.
If there are no other factories with tiles, discard all remaining tiles back into the bag and proceed to end of round scoring.

PLACING/SCORING TILES
You’ll place tiles on your board and score your tiles as normal.

END OF ROUND
At the end of each round, remove one factory.
Before the next round begins, you can spend ten points to reopen a factory.

OBJECTIVE
Your goal is to completely fill your board with tiles before the king closes down all the factories.

For an extra challenge you can play without rotating the remaining tiles in a factory. Instead, you will just discard them.

Respuesta 1:
Nice challenge, thanks for this solo mode !
Two questions :
- Does this variant have a score scale / ranking system?
- Since the goal is to have all the wall filled, I guess you don't score full line/column or all colors as depicted in bottom right corner of the board? Or instead, do you score them during the game as soon as you meet the condition?

Thanks

Tema 62: What name do you use for the colours?
Pregunta:
Just for Fun:
Watching an automa video recently, I heard a tile referred to as "teal." It got me thinking, that some players may use different colour references than I during gameplay (with the exception of the chromatically challenged - no shade).
- I say "dig out the white tile" - I rarely refer to it as the "start" tile.
- these three are also the "white" tiles. I've heard teal, light blue, snowflake, and blue (which is super confusing).
- possibly the most controversial - I say "orange," but my family members insist it is "yellow." How can that be? yellow + red = orange !!!!
- no question. They ARE black, right?


Bonus:
- I still say the "box lid." - What is it at your table? - the bin, the tower, the box?

Wishlist:
- I would love to get my hands on some "Joker" tiles.

Respuesta 1:
Our copy has been played so often that the design on the yellow tiles is fading away. So I call them "yellow" and my friend calls them "formerly orange." But the snowflake tiles are still being called that as the snowflake designs also fade away. One of our friends calls them "diamond tiles" for some reason.

The others are black, red, and blue.

Nooooo. Say it isn't so !?! I was hoping they would last forever. (I honestly didn't know this was a thing.)

Respuesta 3:
I'm trying to think of a context where I'd actually need to name the tiles? Everyone just helps themselves to tiles from the discs or from the centre and then places them on their boards and subsequently scores them? It's not like players have to ask each other for tiles or anything?

That might sound contrarian but it's not intended as such. It may well also be relevant that I'm colourblind and so rarely refer to things by their colour in games since I may be wrong. For what it's worth I would confidently describe the tiles as "black", "white", "blue", "yellow" and "red". It seems the publisher did a good job of choosing the colours.

Respuesta 4:
There is certainly no "need" to name the tiles.

Most of my Azul games tend to be social and vocal, so other plays say things like "How nice, three black!" when taking them from the table, or sometimes someone will say "you took my blue tiles!" to which the response "they aren't your tiles until you take them". Or "where are all the red tiles"?

Others may play differently. I played once with someone who just took his tiles silently the whole game. They only "need" names if they are mentioned.

Respuesta 5:
I strategize aloud ... to ensure the taunt is obvious.

"I see that you need three red to clear your line, but it will only cost me one on the floor. I guess I'm taking them anyway!!!"

I also have color issues, depending on the light. Unless an object is a very stark primary color, to avoid embarrasment I generally find some other way of refering to it, unless another person has already identified it. (In games or anywhere.) That's why I like games that include distinguishing patterns or graphics in addition to color.

There's a whole thread on BGG about this issue.

Respuesta 7:
Snowflake, yellow and black for convenience. No box lid since half the tiles will outside the bag when pouring them back so I use a bowl of some sort depending on where I am playing.
Naming most often comes up when teaching and then I usually reference my choices out load as part of the teach. Lovely game though!

Never occurred to me to go by the symbols or symbol color. I guess because half the time our tiles are on their sides or something where the symbols aren't that apparent. Just never paid attention to them. I don't know why but I tend to focus on the solid sides.

Never occurred to me to go by the symbols or symbol color. I guess because half the time our tiles are on their sides or something where the symbols aren't that apparent. Just never paid attention to them. I don't know why but I tend to focus on the solid sides.
Those are clearly red, blue, black, yellow, and toothpaste.

The Player 1 tile is just called "The player 1 tile", it does not have a colour designated to it, as it is both blue and white, but neither.

Player 1 tile is life.

Player 1 tile is the future.

Tema 63: Misplaced tiles, penalty?
Pregunta:
Recently played a game on the board side where you can freely place colours.

We were four players and it took awhile before we realized one of us had scored to tiles of the same kind on the same vertical row. It’s kind of hard to backtrack from there. What would you have done?

Also we had the longest match we’ve ever had, and there weren’t enough tiles to fill each platter after the last re-shuffle. Is that common? And how do you work that?

Respuesta 1:
I would just acknowledge the mistake, finish the game, and play again!

No, it’s not common to play long matches like that. Almost every game should end in 5 or 6 rounds. 7 rounds is getting long already, and usually would only happen if all players are trying to extend the game.

Respuesta 2:
If we're being generous, I'd let the player move those tiles to another open row, if they had one, as long as there hasn't been a scoring in the meantime. (There's no reason they couldn't have put it in that row, and it doesn't affect the game significantly.) If we're being strict, those tiles would need to go on the floor.

I've never run out of tiles like that, but I guess I'd put out what we could, and play from there. Presumably, you should be in the last round by that point.

Yes, it was the last round, one player was able to finish the round before but we took away his out. We laid 4 tiles on each as long as there were enough, then there was one platter with 2-3 tiles and a couple of empty.

We were strict, took away the seven scored points and returned the tile.

Respuesta 5:
The last round is still triggered when someone completes a horizontal row.

Respuesta 6:
I know there is a big difference between organized competitive play and friendly casual play, but in a tournament situation, if that mistake were caught too late, that player would be given an automatic loss. But I doubt the "free form" side of the board would be used in a tournament setting due to the common and frequent errors when using that side.



Tema 64: Wait, wait, wait. This is a mean game???
Pregunta:
Board games by their nature are a competitive hobby. While there is a whole category of games that are about working together; the core foundation of any board game is that there is winners and losers. Sometimes you are battling other players, other times the game itself, and then there are the times that you are your own obstacle. The people who are naturally attracted to this hobby, tend to fall on the more competitive side of things.



Good board games are also built on a foundation of strategy and game mechanics. A truly great game as its core mechanics, but because of its rules and systems, it allows the players to approach the goal/objective from multiple attack points. A typical game will give you two ways to achieve victory; focus on yourself and build/gather what you need, or attack other players to stop them from achieving their desired outcome and therefore leaving you the victory. Colloquially, this is known as playing ‘mean’. It is while playing the immensely popular game of Azul, that I learned that I am not a naturally ‘mean’ minded player.

The first time that you see Azul, you would never guess that it has the potential for ‘mean’ mechanics. Its’ bright and colorful pieces are often referred to as imitation Starbursts, and players often comment on how “yummy” the game looks (really, would not advise you eat the plastic). Players draft tiles in order to create a mosaic and score points. Depending on which color they draft, the amount of tiles they draw, and where they are placed on the board will determine how efficiently players will complete their mosaic and therefore score points. A misjudged draft may result in broken tiles, and therefore negative points.



I have played many rounds of Azul, with many different groups and player counts. I have immensely enjoyed the game and found to be a very relaxing experience. Games go by quickly and there is a great amount of satisfaction earned by collecting the right colored tiles in the right amount. I have enjoyed this game so much, that we have even gotten into some of the spin-off games; each one adding its own spin onto the tile-drafting formula (in my opinion, the best thing those games have added is a way to easily collect and refill the bag with discarded tiles). What I have never thought of when playing this game, is how mean it is.

Not until I read other reviews and comments on the game, was I introduced into a whole new way to play Azul. Terms like ‘hate-drafting’, sabotage, and ‘mean-mechanics’ were all introduced to me. Up to that point, my entire focus during sessions with Azul was to work my own tiles and make the best with the tiles that I had available to me. All of a sudden, I was introduced to a brand new way to play the game; take the tiles that the other player is needing or set yourself up in a position where they are forced to take negative points.
Though for many people, the potential for meanness in the game will be an obvious conclusion, I believe it illustrates the genius of Azul. It creates that mental connection for a player and suddenly opens the path to all the different strategies that are out there. Anytime, players can experience the same game, play with the same rules, but attack it with two completely different strategies; really shows how immersive and complex the game can really be. Azul operates on many different levels. On one hand, many players have stories of this being their introduction to the hobby of board games. Other players will swear that this is the meanest board game that they have played and that it is now banned from their game night.

Other players will swear that this is the meanest board game that they have played and that it is now banned from their game night.



We need games like this in the hobby. Games that can appeal to newcomers, and veterans of old. Because what Azul truly shows is what board games are capable of. Gone are the days of Monopoly and Risk. Games that are built heavily on luck have been pushed to the side, in replace of games that now focus on strategical thinking. Players can invest time into one game, develop themselves, and then participate in tournaments built around their game of choice. It is one of the things I enjoy most about this hobby, all the different experiences people can have with the same game. I like hearing about how other players felt after they played games that I loved (and games that I hated) because it teaches me about a different way to see a game.



There is a reason that Azul is highly regarded and why you see it all the time on top 10 lists. Players of all types of backgrounds consistently rank this game among their favorites. That alone shows me that this game is worth your time. People (including me) have very fond memories of this game and can attribute a lot of their passion for board games to this game. If you have not tried the original Azul out yet, then I would highly recommend it. Just be prepared for that knife to be thrust into your back (or possibly even to your front).

Excellent review! While I don't believe games can be "mean," and what some call "hate drafting" I consider sound defensive tactics, I do agree with you regarding this type of game. There are actually excellent older abstract games and a handful have been republished, but most are out of print. The fact that newer games like Azul are popular ought to incentivize publishers to sift through the old stuff and republish more of them -- the market is there, as you noted.

Tema 66: Playing with kids
Pregunta:
Because of reasons, I missed a rule when I initially teaching my kids how to play but it makes for a great handicap to help even out our scores a bit when playing with kids so I thought I’d share.

The rules say if you pick up a large set of tiles you can only place them on one row and then have to take the extras as negatives. Our easy modification is to allow our kids (7&5) to split sets they pickup between rows. It means they have more options and flexibility as well as getting less negatives, and allows them to be reasonably competitive. (5yo just beat us all for the win earlier today)

Just wanted to toss it out there as an idea for anyone else looking to play this with younger kids.

Tema 67: Review - Azul (Mr. & Ms. Meeple)
Pregunta:
Hi all,

We've written a review for one of the most popular tile laying games of the past couple of years, named Azul. Have you already played Azul and what did you think of it? You can also find this review on our Instagram: Mr. & Ms. Meeple - Review - Azul.

Azul

: Next Move Games & Plan B Games
: Michael Kiesling
: Philippe Guérin & Chris Quilliams
: 2‑4
: 8+
: 30‑45’
: Pattern Building, Tile Placement & Drafting

If you’ve ever visited Portugal you probably saw a lot of buildings with white and blue ceramic tiles, called azulejos. In Azul you take on the role of a tile-laying artist who has been ordered by king Manual I to decorate the walls of the Royal Palace.

In Azul players take turns drafting same-colored tiles from factories to place them on 1 of 5 rows on their player board. Other-colored tiles are placed into the center of the table. The first player to draft from the center becomes the first player for the next round and receives -1 point. When there are no more tiles left to draft all players move 1 tile from filled rows to the wall area on their board. You discard the other tiles in those rows and refill the factories. The game ends when a player completes a row in his wall area. The player with the most points, after applying bonus points for complete sets, wins.

While the player boards aren’t the best in terms of thickness, Azul comes with colorful and quality tiles which feel great when handling them. We’ve loved Azul from the first play and introduced it to a lot of people the past year who all loved it too. It’s a game you can play with people who are new to the hobby or don’t play a lot of board games. Azul is easy to learn and always a lot of fun.

Despite being easy to learn Azul is a tactical game. You have to think ahead about which tiles to draft and which rows to fill. If you don’t, it’s possible you score a lot of negative points due to tiles you can’t place in 1 of your rows. Sometimes it’s also beneficial to hate draft to block an opponent and deny him a lot of points. We like the puzzle element of Azul and also the fact that it isn’t always the first player to complete a row who wins the game. It’s possible to win without completing a row since you also score points for completed columns and sets. Multiple paths to victory is something we really enjoy.

If you like playing board games you should play Azul at least once to see what you think of it. We want to warn you though, that you’ll probably like it and will want more plays.

Greetings,

Tema 68: Azul Mini score track issue
Pregunta:
I recently picked up Azul Mini. It is mostly functional, except that the score track sliders are so tight you really cannot keep score with them if you hope to keep everything else in place. I was looking forward to teaching this game to my family, which should be fine so long as no one scores more than 10 points. Am I the only one having this issue?

Respuesta 4:
The score track sliders on my copy seem to be okay. They have the right amount of resistance to keep them from moving on their own, but move easily enough when time to score. You might try loosening yours up a bit with moving the sliders back and forth until they move comfortably.

I tried this, but it didn't really seem to help. Either way, it should really be functional right away, rather than struggling to move these markers for a good 20 minutes as I did without any success.



Tema 69: 2nd tiebreaker
Pregunta:
hey guys, I'm running an event where we cant have ties. in the unlikely event of a tie and number of horizontal rows doesn't break it, whats a good 2nd tiebreaker? went later in the turn? most vertical columns?

Respuesta 1:
Maybe most complete colours, then most vertical columns? (Or vice-versa... as long as you set the criteria up front, either works.)

Respuesta 2:
In your situation it would seem that something simple is best. So perhaps who went later in turn order isn't great because recording the first player is an extra data point that isn't typically recorded? Then again if you're organising a formal tournament you could require this. It does have the advantage of being unavoidably decisive which all the "most/least" options don't; They can lead to further ties.

Most vertical columns seems relatively likely to produce a further tie ...

Maybe fewest tiles remaining in incomplete rows?

It does seem like anything is going to feel rather arbitrary ...

Tema 70: Azul Review - A good game but not an amazing one
Pregunta:
AZUL REVIEW:

The theme in the game Azul is bland. Even though the history of tiles (azulejos) that came from ancient Portugal is cool, it is not very appealing in the game. The theme is a little bit abstract, there isn’t a strong theme behind the history of the game.

About the artwork, in the game Azul, it is one of the best rated categories of the game. The aesthetics are very vivid because the colors and design of the game are very eye-catching and the tiles, that are one of the most important things, are very beautiful. The designs are more child friendly than the way you play the game. Even though the graphics are youthful, adults are more likely to fully understand its complexity.

To talk about the gameplay in general, in the game Azul we have to point out the interaction and the replayability of the game. The interaction in this game is not very good but it isn’t boring either. It is kinda fun because many times you say things like “oh no, you got the ones I needed!”.

The replayability in this game, on the other hand, is very good. We have a lot of reasons for that. The game azul is a game that is good for up to 4 people but it is also very good for playing with 2 people, and this is something that not all the games have. Also, we have different types of boards and the tiles change every round, that means that you can score a lot of points in one round but in the next one play really bad.

The balance of the game Azul involves luck, the different strategies to win the game and the experience a player has in the game. The luck in this game is a little bit murky because you need this luck on specific occasions, so it involves more strategy to win, but if you need a tile and in this moment it comes for you, it is a type of luck. We have two different basic strategies to win the game: by placing the tiles and scoring points during the match, or by completing more columns, lines and diagonals, so you score more points at the end of the game, at the time to count the points.
The experience in this game, different from the game of chess, in which a pro player would never ever lose to a beginner, in this game we don’t have much difference, so it is more possible for a beginner player to win against a pro.

Duration in the game Azul is a very good category to review. The duration is tasteful, because it is a good time of a game, it is not very long so it gets boring, but it is not very short. It is tasteful because it is in the middle of both, it is a duration that when the game ends, you continue willing to play.

In general, Azul is not outstanding, but it is good. It doesn’t have a bad rating in all the categories. The artwork and replayability, for example, are good things in this game, because the artwork in it is admirable and it is a game that is very good to play with 2 to 4 people. Besides, when the game finishes you continue willing to play Azul, because the duration is very good too. The game doesn’t become boring but it is not very fast. On the other hand, the theme of it is not amazing, so when you see a game that is about portuguese tiles - like Azul - you don’t feel like playing it very much, but when you play, it proves you wrong because it is fun.

True. I’ve taken tiles directly to my penalty floor many times simply to prevent my opponent from scoring.

Respuesta 3:
After almost 1,000 plays, I have around a 400 rating on BGA, great but nowhere near the upper echelon. I would almost always wipe the floor with a 200 player, and get my clock cleaned by a 600 player.

Respuesta 4:
I will respectfully disagree with your comments on interaction and luck. I've played a grand total of twice so I'm nowhere near an expert in the field, but I spent most of my time playing evaluating what moves my opponent was likely to make so that I could maximize my personal benefit while minimizing theirs. As far as luck: there's a little bit with the tiles available, but there's so many of them you almost always have something useful. You have to strategize in a manner that gets you these tiles and your opponent the garbage.

Without hate drafting and working towards ending the game as opposed to high scores … this game is terrible

Tema 71: Nutshell Review: Azul
Pregunta:
No-Fluff Nutshell Reviews: succinct game reviews that quickly convey the critical points || Chronological Order (Compact) || Alphabetic Order (Geeklist)

INTRO
In Azul, you take turns choosing from among piles of four randomly selected tiles of five possible colors each to add to your wall building project. You are trying to fill in a 5x5 grid wall, which requires exactly five of each color. There are some specific rules to follow on how many tiles you place and where they can go, because you can't put more than one of a color on a row or in a column. A round ends when all the tiles are taken, and there is scoring done each round. But tiles you couldn't properly use score against you. Then you reset the offers and do more rounds until someone completes a row. Despite my mundane description and the thin theme of doing this tile work for a Portuguese king, this is a great game!

PROS
>Easy enough rules for kids to play, even non-readers, but plenty of depth and meaty decisions to make for adults.
>I really like the crunch at the end of a round as you have to try and get the right number of the right kind of tiles without having a bunch of extras suck points away.
>Very beautifully produced.
>There is something satisfying about being able to grab just the right offer of tiles for that row you need to complete.

CONS
>Nothing significant.

FINAL THOUGHTS
We have recently taught this game to our 6 year olds and they have taken to it very well. One of them likes to make me score for him, but the other is happy to do it herself. This is a wonderful family weight game that looks great on the table and we'll keep it in our collection. I'm going to put 6+ on the age range for this game.

Tema 72: Azul: Beginner's Strategy Tips & Tricks
Pregunta:
1. Master the Art of Tile Drafting

Tip #1: Be Flexible with Your Tile Choices

One of the most important aspects of Azul is tile drafting. To draft effectively, you should be flexible with your tile choices. Rather than focusing on a specific color, consider the available options and the potential points they can earn you. This will help you avoid getting stuck with unwanted tiles or missing out on scoring opportunities.

Tip #2: Keep an Eye on Your Opponents' Boards

Another crucial aspect of tile drafting is monitoring your opponents' boards. If you notice a player struggling to complete a row or column, you can potentially block them by drafting the tiles they need. This strategy can be particularly useful in the later rounds when players have fewer options to recover from a poorly chosen tile.

2. Focus on Completing Rows & Columns

Tip #3: Prioritize Completing Rows & Columns

When placing tiles on your board, prioritize completing rows and columns. By doing so, you'll maximize your scoring potential, as completed rows and columns earn bonus points. Additionally, completed rows and columns provide more opportunities for adjacent tile placements, further increasing your score.

3. Capitalize on the Scoring System

Tip #4: Understand the Scoring Multipliers

Azul's scoring system includes multipliers for placing tiles in specific patterns or adjacent to existing tiles. Understanding these multipliers can greatly improve your strategy. For example, placing a tile horizontally and vertically adjacent to other tiles earns you additional points. Focus on maximizing these multipliers to optimize your score.

Tip #5: Utilize Negative Points to Your Advantage

Although negative points are generally undesirable, they can sometimes be used to your advantage. If you're forced to take a tile that doesn't fit on your board, consider whether the negative points are worth the potential long-term benefit. In some cases, a small loss in points may be worth it if it allows you to complete a high-scoring pattern later on.

4. Plan Your Moves Ahead

Tip #6: Anticipate Future Tile Needs

As you progress through each round of Azul, it's crucial to plan your moves ahead. Anticipating your future tile needs can help you make better decisions when drafting and placing tiles. By thinking a few moves ahead, you can avoid ending up with unwanted tiles and maximize your scoring potential.

Tip #7: Adapt Your Strategy Based on Tile Availability

Since the tiles available in each round are random, it's essential to adapt your strategy based on what's currently available. Be prepared to change your plan if you can't draft the tiles you need. By staying flexible and adapting your strategy, you'll be better equipped to handle any surprises the game throws your way.

5. Exploit End-Game Scoring Opportunities

Tip #8: Keep Track of the End-Game Bonuses

End-game bonuses can make a significant difference in your final score. Remember that you'll receive bonus points for each completed row, column, and set of five tiles of the same color. Keep track of these bonuses and aim to complete them before the game ends to maximize your score.

Tip #9: Watch for Opportunities to Block Opponents

As the game approaches its conclusion, keep an eye on your opponents' boards to identify opportunities to block them from completing their end-game bonuses. Drafting tiles that prevent them from completing rows, columns, or sets can give you an edge in the final scoring.

6. Practice Makes Perfect

Tip #10: Play Often and Experiment with Strategies

The best way to improve your Azul gameplay is to practice regularly. Each game will provide new insights and opportunities to experiment with different strategies. As you gain experience, you'll develop a better understanding of how to optimize your tile placement and scoring, ultimately leading to consistent victories.

For the full strategy guide, check out my blog on the topic https://theboardgamer.org/strategy-guide/how-to-win-at-azul/

Respuesta 1:
Thanks for putting the time into writing and posting this article. A lot of good stuff here. One thing I'd like to add: finishing rows and columns can sometimes be beaten if your opponent successfully focuses on making a huge cluster. If the game ends in the minimum 5 rounds, it is possible to win without a column. But yeah, if it slips into round 6, you better have a column if not a complete color.

Again, thanks for the post. Azul is a game that lends itself well to strategic discussions.



Tema 73: Which Azul for 4 players? (After the first one)


Tema 74: Games for Two Mini Review
Pregunta:
A mini review after 23 (now 31) plays, taken from our blog Games for Two

The latest in the collection of games we have only played on boardgamearena, Azul is an abstract game of tile collection. Nominally there is a theme about building beautiful tiled floors - this influences the artistic design of the tiles, but it has little to do with the game play. We have played mostly with three, though also with four and a little with two.



Rules

Every player has a board with a five by five grid of squares marked with five different tile designs in diagonal lines, each design appearing once per row and column. Getting tiles onto this grid is how points are scored. To the left are five rows of empty squares for tiles, at the top is a single space, increasing to five in the bottom row. Rows can be filled with any single design. At the end of each round, completely filled rows result in one tile of that design moving to the grid on the right, incomplete rows remaining between rounds.

In the centre of the table are a number of circular boards depending on player count. All are filled with four tiles randomly drawn from a bag. In the centre of the boards is the first player marker. Players take turns to pick up all matching tiles from one board or the centre. Taking from one of the boards results in all the other tiles from that board being placed in the centre with the first player marker, Drawing from the centre gains the first player marker if present, taking effect the next round. The drawn tiles are then placed in any of the five rows on the left of the player board, either matching what is there or filling a new row. Any tiles that don’t fit onto the row, including the first player marker, go onto a special row at the bottom of the player board that loses one point per tile, losing more points as more tiles are added.

The round ends when there are no more tiles either on the boards or in the centre. Completed rows then move to the scoring grid, in order from top to bottom, scoring a point for each connected tile in orthogonal rows and columns. So a tile on its own is one point, and a row or column of three is three points. Points are deducted for any tiles in the special row.

The game ends if any one player completes a row of five tiles. That round is scored as usual then players gain two and five points for each completed row and column respectively. There are also ten points for filling all five squares of each of the designs. Highest score wins. Scores tend to be in the region of fifty to eighty so these bonuses are often significant.

Opinion

We haven’t played this physically, though everything we have read and seen suggests the tiles are thick and very nicely produced. The tiles have different colours and patterns so should be colour blind friendly. It is quite colourful for an abstract game.

We have found this game simple to understand with a moderate level of strategy over several rounds and tactics within a single round. Every game feels a little different due to the random distribution of tiles on the boards and mostly as what is on offer depends greatly on what your opponents are collecting. There can be tension between finishing a part completed row so that it is available for a different design next round, and grabbing a large collection of a different design before an opponent. Similarly deciding whether it is worth taking a single tile that you really need or waiting until there is a larger number in the centre, but risking the tiles being taken. The players have a fair amount of control over when the game ends, either pushing for a quick end by completing the easiest single tile row at the top of the board, or taking time to fill the lower down rows and complete columns or all tiles of one design. Further interesting decisions come from judging when it is worth taking the first tiles from the centre or a group that is larger than desired, so also losing points from filling the bottom row of the player board.

We have found it can be somewhat of a mean game, especially with only two players. Towards the end of each round there can often be a few unplayable tiles, and occasionally a big pile of seven or more of one design. Players will avoid taking them until one is forced to, which can feel a little random at higher player counts and malicious at lower player counts. As a result our preference is to play with three or more.

Overall we have found this an enjoyable game that we keep returning to, especially turn based. We have however decided it is not a game we wish to own because we haven’t enjoyed it with only two players.

Summary

Good Points
Relatively simple rules
Tactical and with light strategy
Lots of variability and indirect interaction

Bad points
Too mean for us at two players

We haven’t played this physically, though everything we have read and seen suggests the tiles are thick and very nicely produced.
This is one of the few games that I enjoy on BGA, as the interface is minimal and you can see the entire game state at a glance. That said, the physical version is great. The pieces are plastic, but still feel good to handle. If you've ever played  , it's a similar tactile feeling.

As for meanness, yes. There's a cutthroat aspect to "correct" or optimal play that sometimes involves dumping piles of negative points on your opponent. Pacing, planning, and avoiding this is part of the game.

When playing 2p, we find it is essential to keep an eye on the pile in the middle. If one colour is getting out of hand, it is usually beneficial to pick them up before the pile gets too ridiculous. It may hurt a little, but better than it hurting a lot a few turns later. Probably true at other player counts but we mostly play 2p, so cannot comment.

Tema 75: Variant on a solo variant
Pregunta:
This s a variant on
Box of Delights
@ricky2002
's excellent solo variant for Azul, available here: https://www.boxofdelights.net/azul. I love this variant for its simplicity, but I don't like that you always know what tiles the dummy will take and that the dummy always goes for the largest group of tiles. So I use the modified variant below.

SETUP - no change

GAMEPLAY - no change

ON DUMMY'S TURN - replace with the following:

Roll 2 d6 of different colors [or roll one d6 twice] - d6-1 and d6-2.

d6-1 shows from which factory display the dummy takes tiles - numbered 1-5 from left to right and 6 for the center of the table. If the display is empty the dummy takes from the center of the table. If also empty - roll d6-1 again.

d6-2 shows which color tiles the dummy takes - 1-5 for the corresponding color on the top line of the player wall (blue-yellow-red-black-white) and 6 for the largest group of tiles of one color. If there are no tiles of the corresponding color, the dummy takes the next available color following the top line of the player wall from left to right (for example: if you roll a 3, which corresponds to red, the next in priority is black, then white).

Target score - no change

Tema 76: Azul mini - design flaw?
Pregunta:
So I’ve just received mini Azul through the post today… And there’s a few simple things that they seem to have overlooked in the design.

The boards are great, but with a little bit of a lip round the edge, they could be stackable, instead of sliding all over each other when together.

The same goes for the presentation tile inlay and the rule book. They’re all different sizes where the book could have fitted inside the inlay and the inlay then clicked over over the top board.

Very minor I know (apologies if it seems pedantic), but would have made the whole point of a travel set much more neat and tidy.

Still, it’s a great game and look forward to playing it on a train or in a pub/hotel soon!

Respuesta 1:
I agree. Also, why on earth wasn’t it a draw string bag or fitted with a zip. Now I have to keep the tiles in a bag inside the bag.

We're nitpicking due to a few missed opportunities. I still think this has a place. No drawstrings on the bag seems pretty dumb though

Respuesta 7:
I don't think the subject is price related. A drawstring is cheaper than a pressure button and handles. What I suggested isn't necessarily more expensive either.

You're saying is that it is too cheap to be criticised. It's a great game and we can still have an opinion on the production.

Respuesta 8:
I have to say the boards are gread except the fact that the plastic is not fully clear transparent an dampen the view of the board. Don't know why they thought this is a great idea. But maybe its a thickness issue of that material and it becomes like that after a certain amount of thickness.

The rest is really good except missing a bag or a cup for storing the stones that got thrown out. I put in a smaller bad drawing from and not needed ones come in the big on or vice versa.
Maybe a design a plate to put stones on it and then throw it inside or something similar to Azul 2 and 3.

Also mentioning the tiles are small not easy to pick up, however with the half ball carving the board holds it until arund 80° until it falls off, perfect for playing while travelling.

And to prevent paying more money for promos and stuff I started creating the addon as usable sheets and also the promo tiles. When I am finished I will post it here on BGG.

Respuesta 16:
Right,I'm late to the party but I only received my copy this week. Indeed the bag situation bugged me enough to come up with a more convenient solution ...here it is : modified the big bag to close it with a zipper, made a smaller bag for the tiles, a small box for the factories and the 1st player ( and the automa cards), keep all the player boards together to avoid friction ...and all goes back in the big bag for storage ...In addition, if you ditch the blue tray and don't close the outer box lid, it still fits in ...best of both worlds in my book

Respuesta 17:
I’m pretty sure the intended solution is to stack everything in the box liner, put the clear lid on top, and then put the liner in the bag.

The box liner doesn’t have any function as packaging; the clear lid has finger holes at the corners; the lid fits perfectly in the liner; the bag is big enough to snugly fit around the liner; and using the bag alone obviously doesn’t work!

edit - In fact, the manual makes repeated reference to the game box tray as a destination for tiles.

Respuesta 18:
I'd only played Azul once years ago, and bought the mini version. I immediately threw the box tray away after unpacking it, but didn't read the rules until now to discover that it was intended to be kept. I did keep the lid tray, all confused about why it was a different type of plastic.

So you put the box, which came with the bag inside, inside the bag. How pleasingly circular!

And the tray that take the factory tiles is for holding the factories during play, for storage they get tipped into the bottom of the blue liner-tray and the factory display is the lid?

Tema 78: Tile Fight — playing on a shared board
Pregunta:
This is a variant for a more confrontational version of Azul. Rules are very similar to the original, with some scoring tweaks. It's easy to play (if a little fiddly).

The guiding principle is: you are jostling for tile spaces on a shared board, and you only score for the tiles which you uniquely place.

Rules:

- Tile Fight Azul is a 2-player game

- Set up as for a normal 2-player game (two player boards and the usual factories), then add an additional player board positioned between the players.

- The tile selection stage proceeds as in the normal game: players alternate choosing tiles and placing them in their pattern lines on the left of their individual player boards.

- When the round progresses to the wall-tiling stage, the players do not tile the wall on their own player board. Instead the players take turns placing their tiles on the corresponding space on the shared board. If both players have filled a particular slot, only one tile is placed (it doesn't matter whose).

- If only one of the players (X) places a tile on a particular slot, and the other player (O) has not filled that tile slot that round, then X gets to place a token on the tile to indicate their “ownership” of that tile. See pic:



Here the X player has claimed ownership of five tiles and O has claimed three. The red and the blue tiles have no ownership token on them because both players placed them in the same round.

- When a tile is place on the shared board, that slot in the wall is now filled for both players, whether the tile is covered by an ownership token or not. Neither player can reserve tiles for that slot in future rounds.

- Scoring is as per normal Azul rules, but only based on the tiles with ownership tokens. So for example if X places a tile that O does not place this round, thus placing an ownership token on it, she scores a point for that tile. If it is next to other tiles with her ownership token on it, she scores additional points for the lines created. In the game above, for example, X scored extra points for placing their ownership tokens adjacent to one another. But because O's tokens are not adjacent to other O tokens, they only scored 1 point for playing those tiles.

- Similarly, end of game scoring is also based on the ownership tokens, by counting who has the most ownership tokens for a particular bonus point category. So, whoever has the most ownership tokens in a particular row or column or colour, gets the bonus points. In the case of ties, no points are awarded for that category.

- The game lasts exactly five rounds, even if one or more rows has been completed before the five rounds are over (which they will be — with two players filling the board the rows fill up quickly).

Respuesta 1:
Some notes and thoughts after a single test play:

- This was both very similar to normal Azul in its basic mechanics, and very different in its feel.

I confess that I've always admired Azul but found it quite chilly. It doesn't get my heart racing. This variant was *very* exciting, heightening the interaction and making for a much more tense game. (Which I like.) In general I prefer games with shared playing areas, and it occurred to me that Azul could be played that way after reading the article I refer to in this post .

- This variant is considerably meaner than normal Azul (or possibly, it's the same amount of mean, but playing on the shared board makes you much more aware of it). If what you like about Azul is the calm and peaceful clacking of tiles on your own board which no-one can mess with, this isn't the variant for you. But you probably know that.

- I'm bad at writing rules – I think I've made this variant sound very complicated. It's really not! You probably don't need to read my rules at all, just go try play Azul on a shared board and you'll figure it out!

- Maybe more plays will reveal degenerate strategies or brokenness, but at least from the first play it seems like it will be deep and strategic, with many interesting choices about where to place tiles so as to deny your opponent bonuses and groups of ownership tokens.

- OTOH it's possible that luck plays a greater role in this variant than in the RAW, because the tiles may come out in such a way that only one player can fill a vital spot. As such, grabbing the first player tile is possibly an even more important move in this variant than in normal Azul.

- Scores work out quite differently to normal Azul, since you're getting many fewer points from your adjacent tiles. So there's a much bigger emphasis on the final bonus scoring. Possibly this balance needs to be adjusted, though based on this play I'm not sure that it's necessary. One change we did use is that we tweaked the scoring of rows, to be worth the same as the score for columns (7 points).

- The board gets very full by the end of five rounds. There will be many more smashed tiles, particularly at the end of the game when it becomes difficult to fill the last remaining slots.

- The game is definitely more fiddly with the addition of the ownership tokens. I used transparent film as a prototype because I didn't want to obscure the tiles underneath, but they could just as easily be meeples or some other token that would be easier to handle.

- One usability problem is that in the factory phase of the round you're placing the tiles on your own player board, in the "waiting line" on the left, but you haven't filled your own wall on the right. So it's hard to keep track of which tiles have been filled on the shared board. We solved this by placing ownership tokens on the walls of the individual boards corresponding to the tiled slots on the shared board. Again, this probably sounds more complicated than it actually is. The pic might clarify:



- My co-tester (aka my 11 yr old son) suggested a variant to the variant, where tile ownership is not settled once they’ve been played. Rather, the players can take back control of the tiles by playing on that slot again. Might be a fascinating tug of war! But the fiddliness factor would be dialled way up. Would definitely need ownership tokens that are easier to pick up and replace. Or a custom board with more space.

- Finally, I'm sure these rules need testing and adjusting, but I was happy with the first test play. It really accomplished what I'd hoped for – a more elbow-throwing, mean, interactive experience. If that sounds interesting to you, please give it a try!

+++

Notes from another test play, with a different opponent (my wife):

- My wife wasn’t so interested in the blocking game that this variant becomes, and missed the combo-rific opportunities in vanilla Azul. You don’t get many chances to rack up Qwirkle-style groups in this version. Max points from a group of tiles was 4, with the bulk of the scoring coming from the end bonuses. I’m into the blocking, she isn’t. She also didn’t like the more punishing scoring from the extra smashed tiles, since we both went into negative point territory at one stage.

She mentioned that some of the strategic considerations of in-game vs end bonus scoring might become more apparent after a few plays. But the aim of the variant was to have a game that’s enjoyable from the first play, so maybe more tinkering to be done.

***
Third test play:

We experimented with a gentler scoring rule, where you score for shared tiles as well as your own tiles. So you’d get a point for laying a shared tile in a round, but not only that, you get points for lines in the board that include your own tiles plus shared tiles. You still don’t score for the opponent’s tiles.

A small tweak with big consequences: scores were much higher, the game gets some of its combo-rific quality back, and it’s quite a lot less mean feeling. This might be the sweet spot for different kinds of gamers — more testing to be done though.

Respuesta 2:
It's nice to see a variant that adds to shared attention and competitive chaos instead of the normal trend of pretending that Unimpeded Puzzle Solving == More Strategic.

Look fun. Going to need to try this. I agree that the markers make it sound fiddly. I wonder if you could get away with using tile orientation to indicate ownership. On the central board that no one is bumping, could you put the tiles on their sides and point them horizontal or vertical? What about not using a central board, keeping the tiles on your own board but simply marking off (with stones or something) the spots that your opponent has blocked?

Respuesta 3:
Interesting ideas! (Including the boy's variant of a variant )

I like Ray's idea of not having a central board but rather putting your own tiles on your board and then marking off the opponent's spaces (and the neutral ones) with something else (coins, tokens from other games, cereal box cardboard rectangles folded in half to form little tents onto which something could be written, etc). It keeps your tiles clear and uncovered, i.e. quick and easy to see your locations and colours, while also easily showing you the spaces that are off-limits to you.

And by having different tokens for neutral vs opponent spaces, you can see if there's any spaces you should aim for so your opponent doesn't get a majority...

Mind you, I haven't actually played it yet, just set it up to test out what would work. Now to wait for someone else to get home so I can try it out...

Respuesta 4:
In plain Azul, the puzzle solving is unimpeded only if all players agree to make it so.

Respuesta 5:
Thanks for your comments!

@rayr and @kkstiles, you’re right that the important thing is the shared playing space, rather than the actual shared board. As long as that shared space is represented on each player’s board, you don’t actually need the third board.

At the same time I have an irrational preference for it to be an actual shared board ^_^ …. At least if that can be achieved without fiddliness.

Here’s an idea: just push two individual player boards together and play on only one of their walls:



And here’s the same thing with Carcassonne meeples:



And @oracol8, you’re right that Azul is already a highly interactive game with plenty of chances to mess with other players’ plans, especially at two player.

I was thinking about what the shared board actually changes, beyond incentivising a strategy of tiling the spots which the other player can’t fill.

The main thing is that it makes the players’ objectives more directly opposed to one another.

This is probably an obvious thought, but in normal Azul the interesting tension is between advancing your own scoring and taking the chance to interfere with your opponent’s. And of course being on the look out for those moments when the two align.

There’s still a bit of that in the shared board version, but a lot of the time you’re going to be wrestling for the same objectives. For me that makes the game more viscerally exciting, because in every move of the game I had to be looking at what my opponent wanted to do and trying to figure out how to thwart it.

But I can imagine that some players would miss having to make the choice between the two kinds of objectives — building up your own wall vs throwing a spanner at your opponent’s.

Respuesta 6:
For a shared wall, one player could place their tiles on edge.

Question: if your opponent finishes and scores a row, before you have placed enough tiles to score the same tile, are your abandoned tiles removed from your board, or left behind as blocking clutter? Cleared at the end of a round?

We played those as smashed tiles. Blocking clutter would be *too* mean, I think.

We started the scoring markers at 20 points, anticipating that there would be so many smashed tiles that someone might go into negative point territory. Which did happen — I was at 18 points (or effectively negative 2) briefly. But overall there were fewer smashed tiles than I thought there would be.

The whole piece is interesting — at least what I can read because most of it is behind a paywall. The TtR comparison is actually just the kicking-off point for the author’s real aim, which is to create an entirely new boardgame, with characteristics of both Azul and TtR, in collaboration with ChatGPT.

But re: Azul/TtR, here’s the key bit:
“ChatGPT: Ticket to Ride and Azul share several abstract characteristics:

Route building: Both games involve building routes or patterns, either by connecting cities in Ticket to Ride or laying tiles in Azul.
Resource management: Both games require players to carefully manage their resources, such as train cards in Ticket to Ride and tiles in Azul.
Set collection: Both games involve collecting sets of specific elements, such as train cards of a certain color in Ticket to Ride or tiles of a specific color and shape in Azul.
Strategic planning: Both games require players to plan ahead and make strategic decisions, such as which routes to build or which tiles to take from the factories.
High replayability: Both games have high replayability, as there are many different ways to score points and the games can be played multiple times without feeling repetitive.
These are just a few of the abstract characteristics that Ticket to Ride and Azul share.”

The key difference is that in Ticket to Ride, it is very straightforwardly obvious how to block routes while in Azul it is a little more complicated. And route blockage in Ticket to Ride is more catastrophic in terms of stopping other people from winning than it is in Azul.

I have never seen Ticket to Ride as an "abstract". I guess I am not as smart as ChatGPT. It would probably drive cars better than me as well. We all have our skills.



Tema 80: Will I like Azul if I don't like Sagrada?
Pregunta:
I played Sagrada once with 3 other players and found it boring. I'm not much of a board gamer and so haven't been able to identify my taste or describe why I don't like it yet, so I initially thought it was because I don't like strategy games in general. But after finding Terraforming Mars okay, Seasons quite good and Kingdomino fun, now I'm not so sure. What I know is that I found the gameplay both boring and frustrating after a while, continuously unable to get many dice that I need and had to monkey patch my originally beautiful glass design because I couldn't throw a dice away without fearing that my opponents would widen their leads even further. I couldn't forgo the score to make my board pretty either because the rules don't allow me to put dice in any place I want, but only in an increasingly smaller pool of possible locations. All in all, it's not a bad experience, but I finished the match feeling empty.
I see many people said that Azul and Sagrada are similar yet different enough, and a few threads along the line of "if I like one will I like the other?", but nothing about if I don't like one should I even try the other.

Respuesta 1:
It's hard to give you an answer to this question. They're different and personally I prefer Azul so you might like this more than Sagrada as well, but then again it really depends on why you actually dislike Sagrada so much. It sounds like you found Sagrada to be too restrictive (it is just that?), Azul might alleviate that but the game has its own constraints as pretty much any puzzle-y abstract strategy game out there. If you want a very flexible abstract with a lot of breathing room, then maybe Cascadia  is a better option. Still, Azul is a very good game. The best advice I can give you is to try Azul online and see for yourself. There is a premium version on BGA (you'll have to join a premium member's table, it shouldn't take too long for someone to pop up) and an uglier rip-off version called Azee

Edit: If you decide to get Azul, you might want to consider Azul: Stained Glass of Sintra . With these PnP boards  you can play the original with the components in the box so you can get 2 games in 1.

Edit 2: In general I highly recommend to join BGA (the free subscription is perfectly fine, and the paid one is well worth the price tag). There are over 500 games and it helps a lot to be able to try them out before buying. It can also help you to figure out what you like and what you don't like. Other similar websites like Tabletopia, Yucata and Happymeeple are also useful depending on what you're looking for.

Respuesta 2:
Yes.

Respuesta 3:
They are both largely themeless abstract strategy games, however I don't find them that similar. Azul has a little more "take that" than Sagrada, as the drafting can be quite brutal for what appears to be a peaceful game. Maybe you need more theme in your games. I think if you are entering the hobby you probably need to cast the net fairly wide and try different things (which you appear to be doing). You'll work out soon enough what YOU do and don't like. And that is all that matters really.

Respuesta 4:
Hard to give a clear answer, but yes it is possible. I don't find Sagrada that big of a thing, without thinking is a bad game (I give it a 6.5). Azul? I love it

Respuesta 5:
I did. but I cannot speak for you.

Respuesta 6:
I can relate. I love AZUL but I have no interest in trying Sagrada . I don’t like the look of it, and I’m not a big fan of using dice as markers.

To be fully open minded I should try Sagrada  before passing judgement, but I don’t see that happening unless it comes to BGA.

You should test out AZUL on BGA. It’s great.

I have Summer Pavilion  which is also great, but the look of Sagrada  also always deterred me from thinking it was for me. The loud colours, and fiddly dismantling of the player board is a non-purchase for me. HOWEVER - if above says there’s a PnP option, I might just give it a try.

Edit: maybe I got that wrong. Are there PnP boards that allow me to play   with a copy of Azul?

Respuesta 7:
I don't think Azul and Sagrada have much in common at all. They are both abstract games where the playing of the game forms beautiful patterns, and they both came out around the same time. I think that is why they got compared, but everything else about the two games are very different. They don't feel the same at all, at least not to me. I bought Sagrada because I thought it was beautiful with the multi-colored translucent dice and bright colors and patterns. I was given Azul as a gift. I played Sagrada four times and decided I really disliked it. It's so fiddly. Everyone working on their little pattern in solitude and usually someone makes a mistake that doesn't get caught until the end, because of all the placement rules. Sagrada became one of the only games I got rid of, trading it for an expansion to another game I own.

Azul on the other hand, is pretty good. It's more thinky in a strategic way, which I like. Even though you are still working on your pattern, it is easy to look at others' patterns and make choices that try to help you and hurt your opponents. It is actually a very mean game when it is played with skill, so that might be a turn-off for some. I don't think it is as pretty as Sagrada, but it's still aesthetically pleasing, and the clacky tiles are tactilely and audibly satisfying as well. I don't love it. But I like it enough to keep in my collection and I will seek to play it when I am in the mood.

Respuesta 8:
I can only say that personally I dislike Sagrada but very much like Azul. Azul still as you fill up your board will have limitations on where you can place tiles but you still have a lot more flexibility in how you fill up your board and the scoring objectives are right there from the start and don't change throughout the game. There will be times you may want to go for certain tiles and you are denied but it never really felt as restrictive to me. Overall I found that that while I like the concept of Sagrada it just has a lot of little things that annoy me. Azul doesn't suffer from those problems and it's also well liked by the people I have introduced it to, which has been a pretty even mix of gamers and casual gamers alike.

If you do pick it up make sure you give the rule book a good read and maybe even watch a how it's played video. I found the rulebook to be pretty easy to understand, but there are a few tricky bits to scoring that are easy to miss if and it may be easier to understand by watching a how it's played video.

Respuesta 9:
Sagrada and Azul are both abstract draft-and-place games where your options get tighter and tighter as the game progresses. Azul has a bit more bite to it in terms of interaction because in order to play well you need to be aware of what other players are going for, so if you're competing for the same tiles you don't let them draft them first, and if left with roughly equal choices trying to stick others with a bunch of tiles they can't use which results in negative points for them. This also happens in rounds in Azul, so the tension repeats at least 5 times over the course of a play, whereas Sagrada has a steady progression toward this tension state that ramps up toward the end of the play. You can do some of this "hate drafting" with Sagrada, but the placement puzzle is more complex and difficult to evaluate at a glance, so it's harder to figure out what does and doesn't work for your opponents so you can draft to stick them with unwanted dice. But in both, you'll encounter situations where you won't be able to do what you want to do, and if that's a significant barrier to enjoyment, you won't enjoy Azul either.

Sagrada isn't a game that you play to make the most beautiful glass design. You play to maximize points, and that's not always going to be the most aesthetically pleasing. If you're bringing non-game considerations into gameplay, you might be more interested in looser experiences where you can go along for the ride rather than being super competitive. I'd say look into games that are heavy on narrative or setting, especially ones that let you explore and experience the world of the game instead of just maximizing for points. Maybe also try a gentler cooperative game or two. That's not to say Azul won't work for you--it might. But it sounds like you're not quite the target market for it.

Respuesta 10:
Thanks everyone for chiming in. By the sound of it I think I'll give Azul a try at least. I don't want to play online for this because BGG says an Azul match lasts 30-45 minutes and I don't want to abandon an online game mid-way even if I'm bored, it would be rude to my opponent. I'll try to find a nearby board game cafe that has this game and convince my brother to have a match with me, he's understanding enough that we can safely bow out of a game early if needed.

Respuesta 11:
As others have said, it's hard to tell you whether you will like a game or not, without knowing you or having more information about your likes and dislikes. That said, a number of years ago we where at "game day" at our local game store and played both AZUL and Sagrada. While we liked both, we definitely liked AZUL a lot more so walked away, that day, having purchased it. Was probably a year later that I got around to also buying Sagrada. After numerous plays of each, I still like both games but, if I had to chose a favorite, from those 2 games, I would still choose AZUL. It is definitely a puzzle type game and as such it tends to skew towards "multiplayer solitaire" although there are definitely ways you can mess with your opponents. Sagrada is also a very puzzle type game, with, IMHO, even less ways to interact with your opponents. Sure you can "hate draft" but usually this isn't a great strategy in this game. I would suggest, if you have a local game store, see if they have an open demo version of AZUL and give it a play. That's the best way to decide if you like it or not.

A little something that's worth noting for casual players who might stumble upon this thread in the future... This is Azul's board, it's normal for people around here to like or prefer Azul. Don't let that discourage you from trying Sagrada if that's something that you're considering, it's a good game if you like the kind of puzzle that Sagrada has to offer.

For sure, they can be, but as said by someone else, this is what helps to make this such a great, light-weight board game. Do you make the "optimal" pick this time around, or do you make a sub optimal pick now, knowing it will help mitigate a forced bad pick towards the end of the round? Or do you make a sub optimal pick, costing you gaining a point or 2 just to force your opponent into a pick that will lose them points?

+1
And yes, it does make a difference. Scoring depends on tiles already in place. If you change the order of placement, you will change the tiles already in place and therefore scoring.
Consider a tile in the left bottom position. No other tiles on the board:
Blank
Blank
Blank
Blank
Red

You have completed sets for the two rows above it.
If you score correctly, the first will give you 1 point (no adjacencies) and the second will give you 3 points (two adjacencies). Total 4 points
Blank
Blank
White
Blank
Red
= 1 point
Blank
Blank
White
Yellow
Red
= 3 points
If you score in reverse order, the first tile placed will give you 2 points and the second, 3 points. Total 5 points
Blank
Blank
Blank
Yellow
Red
=2 points

Blank
Blank
White
Yellow
Red
= 3 points

Anyone who tries to score out of order, I would regard as cheating, even if they would have scored more the correct way.

I've seen it happen. A new player gets excited to score a lower row that is worth a lot of points, skipping over a less-interesting row, thinking it doesn't matter. In that case, it was lack of knowledge, not an attempt to get away with something.

Respuesta 6:
Ack. We have been playing for years and this is the first I have seen about sequential placing and scoring.

We have always played that all tiles are placed simultaneously. (We stand them on edge until counted.) This has the benefit of yielding the same score no matter where you start from. Only now have I realized this is a variant way to score!

Tema 84: Azul vs. Sagrada - for 2-players and for 2+

I currently own both Azul and Sagrada, and personally find merits in both games, but have a preference for Sagrada.

My sister, who is one of my favourite gaming opponents, have very similar views to you regarding dice and randomness, so she also prefers Azul.
I like how the randomness in Sagrada keeps it fresh but it isn't adding complexity but just switching up the gameplay with generally the same mechanics (of course it's different when you add expansions). I like that replayability due to freshness (personal preference), similar to Bites which is a very different style of game altogether

Respuesta 3:
I think Azul has enough randomness, even at 2 players. The assortment of tiles to start each round is (almost) totally random. You're never going to get the same setup twice. There's some ability to predict what your opponent is likely to do, but there are plenty of turns where your opponent has several equally viable moves. You can plan ahead a little, but you're mostly reacting to the board state on your turn, or perhaps the likely board state on your next turn.

Azul can definitely be cutthroat towards the end of each round, where you can set up your opponent to take a bunch of tiles they can't use and score negative points for them. Also, if a player is further ahead on completing a row, that player now has leverage in determining when the game will end.

Respuesta 4:
It is no contest. Azul and only Azul. I am colourblind. Sagrada is unplayable.

Respuesta 5:
No contest for me, at 2, Azul.

Sagrada usually ends up feeling like the game is playing me. There are too few dice each turn to choose from at 2. Usually, I find myself sitting there not thinking which die do I want to draft but which die can I legally place? It's a simple process of elimination until I find the 1 or 2 I can use, so I'm not really making any actual decisions. Just figuring out which if anything I can place or determining which of my 1 or 2 usually bad options is the least damaging. Being forced to take a bad option because it is the only option is not my idea of fun, and that's how Sagrada ends up feeling more times than not.

Azul might have moments that feel that way here or there, but overall, I feel like I am making the decisions. I can even shape which tiles end up being ones I will be forced to take to a certain extent. Azul gives me a much greater sense of agency over my game play; whereas, Sagrada feels so incredibly luck driven that it I just can't enjoy it.

Sagrada can be a little more "difficult" because of the many score conditions that you can choose from in each setup and can be "hard" for new players because you have to think not only in colors but in values too. But is not that hard. And as said before, Sagrada can be impossible to play with colorblind people (I never experienced that I have to say).

Thanks for your input. I have played both games a few more times now, and very much agree with your review. I found Azul having a wider appeal to everyone who I have taught it to and played with so far. Sagrada does have a lot more variability, and to be honest, some of those combinations do not work. I recently played a solo game of sagrada, and as soon as objective cards came up, I knew that there would be almost no chance of winning. I lost by a large margin in that game. in a way, I think that that is what adds value to a game for me, but I can also see how for many others, it can be a source of frustration.

You can start a new line. There is no limitation for repeating colour lines on your board - looking at the left of your board; like Andy mentioned, there is the limitation if you already have that colour in that row in the wall. The only limitation is that you can't split the tiles you just got in between two different lines

EDIT: and clarification

Just make sure that you only place tiles in one line on a turn.

Tema 86: Azul Pirate Mode: A Blazed Review of Azul
Pregunta:
A Cautionary Pre-Face
This is a review of playing a game while high on marijuana. I have my own personal medical reasons for marijuana consumption and absolutely am not attempting to encourage anyone to try marijuana, I am attempting to enable those who already game and already medicate to feel confident combining the two. I understand that, sometimes, we want to medicate as we relax at the end of the day, and we may also want to play a game as we relax – I have definitely felt both of these things in the past and decided that I must just pick one. Wrong! And I just want to prove that.

Quick Info
This is the first game that I had played blazed. My girlfriend and I have played a lot of Azul (and love it) and wanted to see what it would be like to play while high. So here’s a review of Azul, with two players, while both are high (we smoked during set-up). For the sake of this review, I will assume that you’re already familiar with Azul – this is just to help you decide whether you’d like to try Azul, as my girlfriend and I say, in Pirate Mode. Oh, and if anyone’s curious about our methods – pipes! Heck, we’re bein’ pirates!

Theme
Azul’s theme is very solid and very clear. You’re making pretty patterns with pretty little tiles. This carries over brilliantly when smoking. Several times, one of us would comment on the pattern on our queueing station and how pretty it was or how much it looked like a brave new artwork or something bizarre. The gorgeous theme was one of the main reasons that we wanted to try playing Azul in Pirate Mode and it was definitely a good reason. If you at all enjoy the appearance of Azul, then you’ll absolutely love this part of Pirate Mode.

Components
As I was sitting down and writing this, my girlfriend shared a funny piece of her Pirate experience with me. She recalled that she found it pretty tricky to pick up the tiles – recalling that she was constantly asking herself “Why are these so slippery to me right now?“ If you’re wondering how the score tracker was for us, considering how tiny it is, good on ya – I wondered that in hindsight too. My girlfriend and I both had experiences of intense focus on our little black cubes as we intently counted 1, 2, 3, 4, 5. Yeah, sure, we could’ve just moved the cube 5 spaces ahead in one motion – but we both felt that we needed to be extra score and move this little cube as intently as a surgeon mid-operation. The last thing I’d like to say about the components is that it was a real bonus that the tiles are as solid and sturdy as they are. Other games might have you dealing with a lot of cards or cardboard tokens – all of which can be a bit fragile if you grab them a bit carelessly, which a Pirate might do.

Set-Up
As I mentioned in the Quick Info section, we lit up as we set the game up but, credit to Azul, it’s a totally simple set-up. Had no struggle with the set-up and did both at once with ease. Sometimes I felt a bit goofy with my dexterity during the set-up at the beginning of each round, but it was still totally fine.

Gameplay
Alright, here’s where the meat of the Pirate review is – how well we managed to play while blazed. So while there’s not a super intense amount of planning moves in Azul (not anything like Terraforming Mars), it still serves beneficial to give it a little bit of an attempt at planning moves. That part of the game for me was pretty decent. I can’t say that I struggled to plan ahead nor did I struggle to remember those plans… for the most part, that is. There was at least one moment that I remember very clearly. I carefully weighed up my options and deduced that taking two red tiles into my three-line was my best option. So I reached over and picked them up. It was at this point that I had completely forgotten what on earth I wanted to do with them. Not wanting to appear confused to my rival, I plopped them down where I thought, in the moment, made the most sense – taking two tiles directly into the two-line. This impromptu move was not the optimal one and definitely left me self-shorthanded for the rest of the round. I didn’t find this overly irritating, it just served as a little obstacle that posed a bit more of a challenge for me – if I could still win after forgetting what I’m doing occasionally, that’s pretty impressive, right? The other memorable gameplay moment that I had from this Pirate session was when my girlfriend and I sat in (what felt like) a 5-minute silence. Hilariously, she broke this silence by commenting “Damn, this got tense, huh?”. This was also nearing the end of the game when, as you may well know, the wrong move could leave you pretty damn hurt for points. My girlfriend shared with me that she felt like she couldn’t employ a complicated plan, pretty much instead just living turn by turn, as there was just too much to consider for her. She remembered thinking “oh my god, there are so many options, I’ll just take something that looks good”. She had assumed that I had a plan I was sticking with (little did she know), and that she just had to roll with whatever she could take.
I wish I could recall for you what the points were, but I can’t remember and I didn’t take note because, at the time of playing, I wasn’t sure that I wanted to write this review. Anyways, I won!

Final Thoughts
More importantly than me winning, we both had fun. I can absolutely see us playing Azul in Pirate Mode again, I’m sure we will. I wouldn’t recommend playing Pirate Azul without having played Azul before. If you have played it before, you might agree that the rules around the queueing station are a tiny bit confusing to learn at first if you’re going off the rulebook alone. If you’ve got at least one person who has already played, you should be fine to try it out like this. And I think you should! It was plenty of fun and there was a huge mix of fun moments and really tense moments. It felt longer than it was, and even though sometimes I don’t like time feeling longer when blazed, I actually really liked it for Azul. And aside from the times I mentioned I got confused, it was really straightforward.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

So there you go! If you already like Azul, you already safely medicate, and you’ve wondered what it would be like to enjoy both at once (going for a niche audience here), then I’d say to give it a go!

I’d like to think that I’ll do more of these, but sometimes I get carried away with other things and drop other-other things. If anyone sees this and is really interested in more, have a look at my Owned Games and see if there’s anything there that you’d want me to try out in Pirate Mode. Let me know in a message or a comment, either one works, friends!

Tema 87: Factory Warranty - variant
Pregunta:
Our family likes friendly games that build up points. So, the Floor Line rule seemed horrible to us, particularly when you are stuck with -8 points involuntarily at the end of the round. This is our current “fix” to make it a happier game, while still maintaining the Floor Line concept.

Factory Warranty

- When you have excess tiles that you cannot place, put only one down in the Floor Line. Any remaining tiles are returned to the box, under Factory Warranty. (Don’t forget your receipt .)

- (Optional) All Floor Line spaces are only -1 point.

Example:

Joe is the last player in the round to draw tiles. There are five Blue tiles in the middle, so he must take them. Unfortunately, he is only able to put one in the top space. There are four left in his hand. One is placed in the Floor Line, worth -1 point. The remaining three Blue tiles are placed in the box. During scoring, he will have -1 point for each tile in his Floor Line.

This variant does change game strategy, where players are less fearful of those large groups of tiles.

Respuesta 1:
Sounds like a nice variant for family play.

This being said, have you tried with the only change being placing only 1 tile on the floor but leaving the negative points as they are? (or the other change instead)

I mean, in the games I have played, there isn’t that many occasions where you are « forced » to take a large number of tiles and it’s those times that have you fill the entire floor.

There are basically 2 reasons you put tiles on the floor: either you consider the positive of finishing a line outweigh the penalties or you are forced to take tiles you can’t use.

I understand you variant does make it less harsh for the second reason, but I would be afraid it makes it too easy for the first one: completing a line with leftover tiles will never give me negative points so, at worst, I get zero points. I worry it would not give any incentives to learn to « play better » or make it easy to « hate draft » tiles.

Example: there are 5 blue tiles available and your last line is empty and Blue has not been played on that line. Even if I can’t use the blues myself, the only negative for me if I decide to take them is negative 1 point whereas I might be denying you more points than that.

In the end it’s probably not a game changer either way if your variant is reserved for family plays (and it sounds like a neat idea), but I thought I would point out what I think.

Yes, the second reason was the primary purpose for this variant. After a couple games of getting stuck with big negative points, we were kind of turned off by the game design.

The first reason does make it easier, which we actually like. You will likely always gain points, or break even. There is the less common instance where you might be stuck with a color you cannot play, which may result in a net loss play of -1 point. Thus, we find it to be a happier game. It’s bad enough when you can’t get the tiles you want, in our opinion.

However, it does not teach the stronger subtractive element of the base game, as you have mentioned. But many other games like Carcassonne don’t have subtractive elements either, so we find it acceptable. It does play different, but only in regards to the penalty size. Most of the game still focuses on creating your mosaic for point earnings.

Respuesta 3:
Makes sense. Like I said, it seems like as long as it doesn’t lead to hate drafting (which would negate the reason you are doing this), the spirit of the game is preserved.

The penalties isn’t a problem for us but if I introduce it to people who do seem to have a problem, I will keep your variant in mind.

Thanks for sharing

Maybe a mechanic that leaves the tiles on the floor until next round when they can be fed back into the rows later, and with no negative points?

It wouldn’t be Factory Warranty anymore, it would be Warehouse Storage .

There are lots of ways to make a friendly variant of the Floor Line. The Factory Warranty is just one way that we like to play.



Tema 88: What happens if both the bag and the lid are empty after the Wall-tiling phase, but no horizontal lines are completed on any walls?
Pregunta:
This is a dumb edgecase that you'd have to go out of your way to make happen in a 4-player game, but in that event (i.e. all 100 tiles are distributed between incomplete pattern lines and walls but no horizontal lines are complete), would it be considered a draw? Or, would the game be considered ended, bonus points awarded, and a victor chosen as normal? The strict RAW reading favors the first interpretation, since the rules only mention the game ending in the case of a horizontal line being completed. This would never come up in a game, but my curiosity burns.

I think this would be considered a normal ending. If I recall correctly, the rules state that the game ends when the factories can not be fully refilled - it doesn't matter whether you are 1 tile short or the maximum possible.
The rules say that if the factory can't be fully refilled, continue playing as normal even though it's only partially filled. The only reference to a game-ending condition is the completion of a horizontal line.

Actually, it can not happen in a 3-player game. Without triggering normal game end, each player board can hold 4x5=20 tiles on the wall plus 10 tiles as fully loaded incomplete lines, for a total of 3x30=90 tiles among the three players. Since the game has 100 tiles it can only happen in a four player game.

Add this rule:

In the event that no tiles remain in the draw bag or discards and no player has completed a horizontal line at the end of the Wall-tiling phase, return all players' tiles from their draw and floor lines to the bag and begin a new round. Tiles removed from the floor line score negatively as normal.



Tema 89: Really high score in 2-player game
Pregunta:
I thought about posting this under "Sessions" but it is too minimalist for this. Yesterday I played an epic 7-round 2-player game of Azul. I think this is the first time ever I'd seen a 2-player game go seven.

Final score was 141-122. I lost. I had two complete colours and three vertical rows but my friend had three colours, and three verticals. I think I had four empty spaces and she had three.

Truly unusual, I thought - and worth asking if anyone has ever scored higher in a 2-player. I know it must be possible...

I just did some quick math and I think that the highest possible theoretical score is 236 - that's a game where you would finish the first column in round 1, the second column in round 2, etc. That's 141 round-to-round points and then 95 end-game points. Of course this kind of score would require collusion from both players and you'd have to manually seed the tiles each round, so this theoretical score is virtually impossible to see in a real game.

I would say that 141 is a highly unusual score, especially if there was no collusion. That's nearly 60% of the highest score possible. Many scores in high-level 2-player Azul end in the 40-70. It always benefits one player to end the game as quickly as possible. I generally don't like seeing the game go to round 6, because the random re-seed of tiles from a filled bag can completely swing the game. I think I've gone 7 rounds once and I think the winning score was 120-ish.

Respuesta 3:
There certainly was no collusion. Incompetence, perhaps, but no collusion. We played a second game and I lost 70-67, which is where most of our games tend to range. That was five rounds.

My standard refrain if it doesn't end in five is "Round 6 - anything can happen". Truly in seven, the "anything" expands exponentially.

Respuesta 4:
On a few occasions in a 2P game when the game has gone beyond 5 rounds (because we both think we can win a shoot out or we’re both unclear whether a forced finish will win) we’ve topped out in the low 120’s. 141 is a wild score.

Admittedly, I only just got this game, and played twice, both 2-player games but with different opponents.
The first game, we went 7-rounds (I think... because I didn't keep track but for sure we refilled the bag and I didn't think we ended right after the first round of refilling), and I won 83-73.
Second game, we went 6-rounds (again, I think... because for sure we refilled the bag but ended quite quickly afterwards because the "loser" wanted to end her misery), and I won 80-40.
I can see the appeal to ending early if you are clearly leading (as in my case for game 2 - though I wasn't able to finish any rows but ended with 2 verticals and one colour), but is it that often clearly the case?

Often the game ends at five rounds because you are "forced" to end it - that is, your only choice of tiles are ones which would complete a horizontal line. You could of course take these voluntarily as a penalty to force a sixth round, but the odds of BOTH players taking penalties to force a sixth round is small. Games only go six or seven rounds (in 2-player) if the distributions are so bad that no-one has a viable means to complete a horizontal line after five rounds.

I have not experimented with deliberately planning in rounds one or two on a strategy to minimize completing horizontal lines in the hopes of forcing six rounds or more. I think it would be counter-productive unless your opponent was willing to do the same.

But then again, I've only played a few hundred games. There is plenty of time to explore the depths of Azul. But I think - strategically - that you should always play with the assumption that it will end after five rounds, because most of your opponents in 2-player will do the same. Filling i your top two lines each round is the best way to achieve this, if distribution allows.

In both of my games, I did aim to complete vertical lines and avoid horizontal (I guess I wasn't experienced enough to realize others may end the game quickly and mess up my plans). My opponents were also new players so I am excited to play more and see what happens!

On rounds 2-5, you get 2-5 points per row, since you'd build adjacent columns. (2+3+4+5) * 5 = 70

Assumedly this was an 8-round game?

I have played something in the region of 50 games of Azul, we have only ever hit round 7 once, and have never hit round 8, and on the games where we hit round 7 the scores were 110-78 and 106-91.

Azul is an interesting game where at any player count, but particularly 3 or 4, its almost impossible to calculate how many points an opponent can score in the next round, so when losing by say 10-15 points you are likely to NOT deliberately end the game, unless you know it will complete two columns, yet the more rounds that get played the scores for every player rise exponentially.

162 is still an insanely high score, doubt you will ever see that again unless you play a "fun" game with collusion to see if you can beat it.

Looking at my recorded plays (I didnt record plays until this year), there are a total of 24 plays, of which I have played in all 24 of them, against opponents who have either never played, or have played around 10 games;

Top score since recorded plays: 110

You would be allowed to place on the line with just one space, but the extra tile would drop to the floor.



Tema 91: Mom loves Azul. What game should be next?
Pregunta:
My mom is retired. I got her Azul a few years ago, and she loves it. She plays it with me, the grandchildren, anyone who will play a board game she will teach it to.

I asked her what about Azul works so well for her. She said, in no order:
* she likes being able to see all of the factory piles as well as what tiles are in the center. "Knowing all the information."
* she likes being able to see opponents' boards and being able to anticipate what they might do, as well as occasionally trying to spoil their next move, especially if it leads to big points for them.
* she likes that she only picks tiles about four to six times in each round. She likes that the path from start to finish of the round may change, but the round is short enough she can handle the changes without losing sight of her overall goal (not just maximizing points on this round, but also setting up future rounds and whether or not she is trying to end the game or extend the game).

We played the advanced variant (using the blank tile region on the back of the regular scoresheet). She enjoyed it, but came to decide against it because the additional decision making powers were just a bit beyond her capabilities. She is a solid regular Azul player, and wins most of the games she plays. It's not that she didn't like not winning as much; she was clear in stating that the work load of having to plan her board instead of having that laid out for her took the game from being "fun strategy" to "too much mental work and that made it less fun."

I thought that was an interesting point.

Here is my goal: while I do like Azul, I do not love Azul. And while I don't mind playing Azul most of the time when we are playing board games that do not involve words, I was hoping to introduce her to a new board game.

I would like to get her to try a boardgame where it is more of an economic development kind of game. If you've read this far, which game would you recommend I go with to get a solid Azul player excited to play?

Thank you so much! BHD

Respuesta 1:
Describe some games to her and let her decide. Never mind, I just reread what you wrote. She loves Azul. Maybe she doesn’t need to play other games with you. Maybe it’s not even really about the game for her. Play Azul with her and be happy you get to spend time together.

Respuesta 2:
How about  ?

That happened to be the normal progression from Azul that I used to get my wife interested. It seemed to work pretty well.

Respuesta 3:
-- cube drafting; town development
  -- 2-4 players. Tile drafting; city building
  -- 1-4 players. Tile drafting; set collection.
  -- worker placement for 1-4 players.
  -- 2-4 players. 3-dimensional tile-drafting/building. Set collection.
  -- 2 players only. Out of print, so it may be expensive
  -- 2-4 players. Polyomino drafting and placement. Each player builds and populates a zoo.

Nice to read this son and mom boardgaming fun. May be try Splendor ? Not all information clear but enough for nice decisions. Somewhat more economic but still fast and overseeable (is that a word?), you definitely see your opponents business, it plays like a pretty exciting race to end.
Or you can try Patchwork ? All information on the table. More puzzly. Can be hard to break even. Or Kingdomino ? Or that new one from Kiesling: Savannah Park ?
Cheers!

I think   is 100% the game you're looking for. Check out a few reviews from the forums or just read the rules and I think you'll reach the same conclusion.

Respuesta 6:
Splendor  might be a good choice. There is a similar feel having the tableu of cards laid out and being able to see the available tokens and what others have collected during the game.

Respuesta 7:
perhaps?

Though I tend to agree with the post above about just playing Azul, if that's what she enjoys.

Have you tried the usual SdJ Winners? My mum loves Azul but she also loves   and

Another vote to keep playing Azul with her until/unless she's also interested in trying something else.

That said, sounds like she likes open information, lookahead and a combination of big picture goals and manageable subgoals. She may enjoy some modern abstracts like
*   (already in your collection)
*   (I prefer this to HTMF, but it's harder to come by)
*  
*  
*  

Looking over your collection,   might not be a terrible choice. The method of drafting is different and you move to a shared board, but you're still building up groups. Might be a bit busy and the scoring is more intricate.

Sounds like she may enjoy the combination of lookahead and the ability to mess with opponents. Perhaps something from (one of) the same designers of Azul:

Thanks to everyone so far for responding! Mad love for BGG friends!

I do own Planet. She's played it in a 4P game with the grandkids. She liked it in a so-so sort of way.

I bought her "Cottage Garden" for Christmas a couple years ago. She likes it a good amount. I will pull that off the shelf when we spend over a week together during Christmas and I need a break from Azul.

But I am looking for advice pointing me in a direction of an economic game that I might buy for us to try over Christmas that she might really like. Something to open a door for her down that path. I own Caverna, and that is too rules heavy for her, but I did play "Cave v Cave" with a friend a couple years back and that was a lot of fun. I might buy myself that and then see if I can "leave it with her" for the spring if she likes it enough to try it with my sister and the grandkids (who visit her more frequently than I do, the difference between a 2 hour drive and a 6 hour drive). I particularly like that this would be a good intro for her into "worker placement" which is something that I very much enjoy.

I agree, Sagrada is a good choice. But it isn't "economic" enough for me. But it is such a good match I might just buy that for her as a christmas gift and just hope for the best. I know the grandkids will at least like it (one in middle school, the other in high school) and play it a few times as they explore the novelty of it.

I own "Splendor" online (via Steam) and I had forgotten about it. Yes, there is some economy to it. I might also buy that one for her because it is such a good match.

I did show her "Bunny Kingdom" a couple years ago when an ex-girlfriend (who loved that game) was there with us for a couple vacations. That economy was too big of a step for mom right out of the gate.

She bought her own copy of "Blokus" because the grand kids own that game at their house.

I will go look over the Azul expansions. Bill, I will definitely read a lot about every game on your list. And Century Eastern Wonders as well, for sure!

Thank You So Much,
BHD

Ticket-To-Ride. Not an economic engine but uses set collection really well and if she enjoys trying to thwart other players this is a great game for that.
Ingenious/Axio this is another abstract game where you are placing tiles to score points. Due to the scoring mechanic it strikes a great balance between trying to get what you need to do done while also trying to thwart the other players.

would seem the obvious choice for a gateway economic game with a nice theme and tile placement. Like Azul the rules are simple but the decisions as deep as far ahead as you want to think.

From your own collection, I would just suggest that   and   would be the easiest points of entry.

Spreading a wider net,   has some similarities to Azul:
1) players build their own board and
2) each round they are picking tiles from a common offering.

Perhaps thus satisfying:

+1 for trying Azul: Summer Pavilion. I first started playing Azul with my age 70+ parents because I felt that it was a good game for them to easily understand the rules and that they'd eventually take to figuring out proper strategies. We started playing Summer Pavilion at some point and they now prefer that over the original. Summer Pavilion is a more complex game and it's possible your mom may run into a similar mental work issue, but if she is able to take to it, then at least you'll have two different versions of Azul you can mix it up with.

Tema 93: Not So Premium Collector Tiles
Pregunta:
Has anyone else purchased the collector tiles on Plan B's website? If so, what was your experience with the tiles?

As you can probably guess from the title, my expectations of the tiles did not meet the reality of the tiles. I ordered both the Ultramarine color and the Yellow color. Upon opening both boxes, quite a number of the tiles were scuffed on the sides and a bit dirty. No doubt this is probably natural from the manufacturing process, so I washed them with some tap water. However, even after washing them, I noticed that the tiles still looked a bit scuffed up (if anyone has any good solutions for how to make them look less scuffed up, please do share). Due to the colors, it's really hard to tell the scuffing on the yellow tiles, but also really easy to tell on the ultramarine tiles.

However, what I honestly find most egregious is that the tiles, when compared to the original tiles from the game, feel very different, and decidedly less premium. First, the collector tiles feel like they have less heft, and maybe I was just imagining things, so I decided to objectively measure it to see if I was just imagining it. I just took a group of 5 tiles at a time and measured them on my small kitchen scale - the collector tiles consistently came in the 15-16 gram range and the original tiles consistently came in the 17-18 gram range. I then took a group of 10 tiles and the collector tiles weighed in at 32 grams per group and the original tiles weighed in at 34-35 grams per group. So maybe that difference is negligible, and honestly, I don't know how fine of a difference becomes discernable/not, but the feel test and the weigh test seem to both suggest the tiles are less weight-y. Which in a tactile game like this, perhaps makes a difference. Second, the collector tiles don't have the glossy feel of the base game tiles (it's more of a matte coating feel; sorry if my description is a bit lacking). Finally, when looking at it from the edge, the new pieces just look slightly smaller than the original tiles (it may be because of how the rounded edges are cut rather than any actual thickness difference).

Take from all this what you will. Perhaps I am being too picky, but I don't feel like I'm asking for too much when I say I want tiles that look and feel like ones from the original game. ESPECIALLY considering how much they cost, I'm not expecting crystal encrusted game pieces, but when two sets with shipping cost about as much as the game itself, you can imagine perhaps why I'd expect some more consistency/better quality control. I'm sure some of this expectation also has to do with the fact that pretty much every version of Azul has excellent production value. I also realize this is potentially an issue across the board gaming sphere (if any of you are following the ongoing saga of the cards backs from Undaunted: Reinforcements, you know what I mean), so I'm not blaming this on Next Move Games or Plan B Games.

I reached out to Plan B Games through the customer support page on their website a couple of days ago, so I'll wait to hear back from them. Maybe I just got a bad batch of tiles. Until I know more, I would personally recommend anyone looking to get the tiles to stick to the base game, and pass on these tiles.

Don't get me wrong, the patterns are gorgeous, and the new tiles still look cool, but for the price, they just miss the mark for me.

I'm going to modify (marker/sticker) one side of the original AZUL Factories to create a Wall and a Left/Right version for the Special Factories Promo, and apply a one side x2 (double score) sticker to 5 original tiles (+ PnP rules),

I'm going to PnP the Power-Up Card, and the Summer Pavillion Bonus tiles (+ PnP rules).

For the Joker tiles I can apply a Joker sticker to 10 tiles, (+ PnP rules).

As long as the stickers are thin, strong, and clear, I think they should be almost unnoticeable when drawing from the bag.

The Collector Tiles look pretty yummy though, despite your forgivings. I imagine, playing with a full set by themselves would render the differences you point out as very low impact.

I would agree that it is most definitely possible to DIY all the promos at home; they are honestly a bit on the pricier end. And yes, with an entire set, the differences would probably be moot.



Tema 94: First Turn Advantage in Azul 2P
Pregunta:
As we all know first turn advantage is an inherent problem in all turn-based competitive games.

There are games where going first grant you a significant advantage (52%+ winrate for going first) such as Through the Ages, 7 Wonders Duel and Chess.

Then there are others which try to mitigate or minimize first turn advantage (not always successful) by balancing around it, such as Tzolk'in, Tokaido and Hearthstone.

Where do you think Azul sit on this spectrum? Do you feel that going first in the first round grants a noticeable advantage?

Quote:

Respuesta 2:
Chess: Yes, so I've heard. With a standard set-up and choreographed openings, it makes sense that first move confers an advantage.

7 Wonders Duel: Never noticed it. Are you referring to the "7 Wonders Selection Phase"? They use a simple "snake draft" 1-2-1 and I prefer the second position . I don't see any significant advantage to selecting the first card in the first round.

Azul: I've logged 53 plays (played many more) and it has never occurred to me that there is any noticeable advantage to going first in the first round. We usually follow the rule "whoever lost the last game goes first in Azul", so we acknowledge a potential advantage. I did see this in the Azul "general comments" which suggests that first player isn't much of an issue:
Quote:
After 350 games, I have no "set strategy" I can fall back on. No style of play which is guaranteed to lead to victory.
...and no mention of "first player issues" which is the way that I feel, too. I'll play second every game if my opponent prefers and never feel disadvantaged.

I'm pushing 450-500 plays of 2-player Azul and have spent quite a bit of time thinking about the "problems" with the game. Being first player is great, but there is not an inherent problem with it. If anything, the issue is that whoever goes first in a round is often in a good position to retain the first-player tile; but it is the responsibility of the second player to be mindful of what tiles they are sending to the middle.

I think the bigger problem in the game is the random tile distribution which, when coupled with turn order, can be devastating. In a handful of my plays, I've started the game as second player and truly felt that I had lost the game during setup. One of your goals in the game is to place tiles adjacent to each other so that your round-to-round points snowball from start to finish. I have experienced starting tile distributions where the first player had a draft sequence where they were able to complete the top 3 pieces of a column, and the second player was only able to get a tile in the 1st, 3rd, and 5th columns. This can be disastrous against a high-level player, since the indirect interaction is so intentional in the 2-player game.

If you want a real solution to your problem, go play   which is vastly superior to the original game.

Respuesta 4:
" I've started the game as second player and truly felt that I had lost the game during setup."

Yep. After 600+ games, I have seen distributions that just gave the first player a serious advantage. But it isn't a game-breaker for the game as a whole.

On a spectrum of 1 being “it makes no difference whatsoever” and 10 being “this game is completely broken” Azul is about 3/10.

Tema 96: Brettspiel im Mondschein [German Review / Deutsche Rezension]
Pregunta:
(zuerst im Blog „Brettspiele im Mondschein“ gepostet)

Azul – ein Fliesenlegespiel von unendlicher Schönheit.

Material
Das Spielmaterial ist wirklich ausgezeichnet. Ein wunderschön bedruckter Stoffbeutel mit 5 verschiedenen Sorten Fliesen (je 20 Stück) und dazu noch eigene Spielertableaus und mehr machen Azul zu einem bezaubernden Spiel für die ganze Familie.

Mechanik
Je nach Spieleranzahl werden Manufakturplättchen in die Mitte gelegt. Darauf kommen dann jeweils 4 zufällige Fliesen. Ist man am Zug, nimmt man sich alle Fliesen einer Farbe auf einem Plättchen und legt sie in eine Reihe des eigenen Tableaus. Die ungenutzten Fliesen kommen dann in die Tischmitte, aus der man sich auch eine Sorte nehmen darf, wenn man dran ist. Auf dem eigenen Tableau muss man dann Reihen gleicher Farben bilden, die unterschiedlich lang sind. Daher kriegt man Minuspunkte, wenn man sich zu viele einer Farbe genommen hat. Die Herausforderung bei dem Spiel ist es, das Muster nämlich so zu füllen, dass es die meisten Punkte bringt. Daher gilt es genau zu überlegen, in welche Reihe man die Fliesen hinlegt.

Pro
+ Einzigartige und schöne Spielmechanik mit perfektem Auswahlmechanismus
+ Wunderbare Gestaltung und hochwertiges Spielmaterial

Kontra
- Man traut sich vielleicht nicht, ein weiteres Spiel der Reihe wegen zu hoher Erwartungen zu kaufen

Fazit
Azul hat nicht ohne Grund die Auszeichnung Spiel des Jahres 2018 erhalten. Es macht alles richtig und ist niemals langweilig. Das Spiel gehört in jedes Regal!

Wertung
9.5 / 10 – Ausgezeichnetes Spiel!

Complexity: Low to start; quick teach

Tl;dr – Fast teach, easy to pick up and play even with inexperienced gamers. Seems simple at first but the more you play, the more you pick up on nuances and strategies that give the game surprising depth. It’s pretty but there isn’t much feeling of theme. The games are not too long and never feel like they drag on. This is a great game for people who like to think and plan, who have a bit of competitiveness but don’t want to outright create conflict, and who enjoy abstract games that don’t need a strong theme.

I’ve been holding off on reviewing Azul for a while now because every time I play it and every time I think I’m over it, something happens to change my mind. This tells me I’m still discovering the game and it’s been an enjoyable process. After dozens of plays now, I think I know enough of what’s going on to give a fair assessment of Azul.

This is not the type of game I usually like – it’s abstract, there’s not a strong theme, and it feels like chess at times. But this is a fantastic game that has probably seen more play time than anything else with my group lately, from my wife who is just starting to dabble in board games to my friends who play chess competitively. I give this a 19/25 overall and will discuss why.

Aesthetics: 3/4

Azul is pretty. The tiles feel nice and thick, have a satisfying sound when clinking together, and the colours pop. The patterns on the board are beautiful. It’s just really pretty, but it’s not grand, engrossing, exquisite.



Theme: 2/5

There is a theme here but it doesn’t come out strongly. You’re a tile-laying artist drafting tiles from suppliers for your store. The tiles are interpretations of azulejos which are ceramic tiles loved by the Portuguese king Manuel I who brought them from Spain. None of this is apparent when you play, it never crosses your mind. You are picking tiles and putting them in spots on your board.

Gameplay: 5/7

In short, you are taking tiles from a shared supply, placing them in rows on your player board, and then scoring the completed rows at the end of the round. How much gameplay can there be with such a simple mechanic? Surprisingly, a lot.

There’s an element of set collection here where you are trying to get the right tiles to complete bonuses for the end game. There’s an element of conflict and defensive play where you are trying to deny your opponent the tiles they need, or if you’re even better, try to force them to take tiles that will cost them a lot of negative points – whilst trying to prevent the same thing happening to you. If you start a round with your bottom 2 rows partially filled there’s a sense of danger because you don’t have many spaces to accommodate tiles, and the excess will result in negative points.

As you get better, you’re trying to think several moves ahead to who will be forced to take from the middle first, and who will end up with the last draw (and therefore take the massive amount of tiles left). This is usually ok when people follow the predictable choices, until someone throws a spanner in the turn order by drawing from the middle before exhausting the suppliers first. Now the possibilities have increased threefold and you have to watch the board evolve with each player’s move to try and plan ahead.

It’s the right amount of competitive without disrupting entirely what you’re trying to do for yourself. There’s enough strategy and depth to keep you thinking even though it’s such an easy teach.

Duration: 3/3

Azul doesn’t overstay its welcome and players actually have some control over when the game ends (by completing a row), which adds another element to it. There is no point where it feels like the game has dragged on too long – and if it ever did feel like that you could just end it yourself.

Balance: 3/3

Azul never feels unfair. All players get a roughly equal chance of winning and there’s enough randomness that even if a player is a bit better than someone else, they won’t always win. However, if you are significantly better than someone there is a strong chance you’ll win. There is an element of turn order (usually) forcing a player to take the negative point in the middle, but it doesn’t impact the gaming experience.

Replayability: 3/3

I tossed up between 2 and 3 for this. I usually don’t feel a craving to play this game because I prefer stronger themes and more obvious player actions versus the abstract and nuanced gameplay of Azul. However, whenever I do play it, it’s undeniable that Azul makes you want more. It’s never just one game.

Seems simple at first but the more you play, the more you pick up on nuances and strategies that give the game surprising depth. It’s pretty but there isn’t much feeling of theme. The games are not too long and never feel like they drag on. This is a great game for people who like to think and plan, who have a bit of competitiveness but don’t want to outright create conflict, and who enjoy abstract games that don’t need a strong theme.

I’ve been holding off on reviewing Azul for a while now because every time I play it and every time I think I’m over it, something happens to change my mind. This tells me I’m still discovering the game and it’s been an enjoyable process. After dozens of plays now, I think I know enough of what’s going on to give a fair assessment of Azul.

This is not the type of game I usually like – it’s abstract, there’s not a strong theme, and it feels like chess at times. But this is a fantastic game that has probably seen more play time than anything else with my group lately, from my wife who is just starting to dabble in board games to my friends who play chess competitively. I give this a 19/25 overall and will discuss why.

Aesthetics: 3/4

Azul is pretty. The tiles feel nice and thick, have a satisfying sound when clinking together, and the colours pop. The patterns on the board are beautiful. It’s just really pretty, but it’s not grand, engrossing, exquisite.



Theme: 2/5

There is a theme here but it doesn’t come out strongly. You’re a tile-laying artist drafting tiles from suppliers for your store. The tiles are interpretations of azulejos which are ceramic tiles loved by the Portuguese king Manuel I who brought them from Spain. None of this is apparent when you play, it never crosses your mind. You are picking tiles and putting them in spots on your board.

Gameplay: 5/7

In short, you are taking tiles from a shared supply, placing them in rows on your player board, and then scoring the completed rows at the end of the round. How much gameplay can there be with such a simple mechanic? Surprisingly, a lot.

There’s an element of set collection here where you are trying to get the right tiles to complete bonuses for the end game. There’s an element of conflict and defensive play where you are trying to deny your opponent the tiles they need, or if you’re even better, try to force them to take tiles that will cost them a lot of negative points – whilst trying to prevent the same thing happening to you. If you start a round with your bottom 2 rows partially filled there’s a sense of danger because you don’t have many spaces to accommodate tiles, and the excess will result in negative points.

As you get better, you’re trying to think several moves ahead to who will be forced to take from the middle first, and who will end up with the last draw (and therefore take the massive amount of tiles left). This is usually ok when people follow the predictable choices, until someone throws a spanner in the turn order by drawing from the middle before exhausting the suppliers first. Now the possibilities have increased threefold and you have to watch the board evolve with each player’s move to try and plan ahead.

It’s the right amount of competitive without disrupting entirely what you’re trying to do for yourself. There’s enough strategy and depth to keep you thinking even though it’s such an easy teach.

Duration: 3/3

Azul doesn’t overstay its welcome and players actually have some control over when the game ends (by completing a row), which adds another element to it. There is no point where it feels like the game has dragged on too long – and if it ever did feel like that you could just end it yourself.

Balance: 3/3

Azul never feels unfair. All players get a roughly equal chance of winning and there’s enough randomness that even if a player is a bit better than someone else, they won’t always win. However, if you are significantly better than someone there is a strong chance you’ll win. There is an element of turn order (usually) forcing a player to take the negative point in the middle, but it doesn’t impact the gaming experience.

Replayability: 3/3

I tossed up between 2 and 3 for this. I usually don’t feel a craving to play this game because I prefer stronger themes and more obvious player actions versus the abstract and nuanced gameplay of Azul. However, whenever I do play it, it’s undeniable that Azul makes you want more. It’s never just one game.

Tema 100: Can excess tiles be placed on another line in lieu of placing on floor line?
Pregunta:
Tiles are picked and added to one of the 5 pattern lines, filling all spaces of the pattern line. You can have more than one row with the same color in progress (i.e. page 4 of rules).If there are excess tiles left over can you place the excess tiles on another empty row or a row of the same color. Can you do this before you place the excess tiles in the floor line?

Respuesta 1:
All of the tiles you take in one action must be placed on one line, or on the floor. If you get more tiles than you need to fill a line, then the rest must go on the floor, even if you could (theoretically) put them on another line.

No.

Respuesta 3:
No.

If you could, the game would no longer be so mean. And who wants that?

Respuesta 6:
Indeed... After 50+ games you start to snipe others and count tiles so that they lose points while you make some. My son kept me at 0 for a few turns once... It was savage and beautiful all at once.



Tema 101: Can you play regular and gray board in the same game?
Pregunta:
My 8 y.o. suggested this way:
player 1 uses the regular board
player 2 uses the gray board

I used the gray board, the kiddo used the regular board.
We followed the same rules to play and score, had a great time, and the kiddo won.


Questions since we aren't that experienced yet:
1) Do the rule prohibit it?
2) Would one of the players have a disadvantage?
I thought the gray board would have advantage because you can plan where to put tiles to get the highest score and it's easier on completing all rows with one same color, but i lost the game.

have you tried it? Did you like it?

Respuesta 1:
The game rules say that each player must use the same side of the board, so players separately choosing which side they play would be a house rule, suitable for the variant forum.

What is typically found is that beginners start on the colored side, then as players advance in skill they go to the grey side for some variation and to try out some ideas, and when they become more expert they return back to colored side and appreciate the restriction.

I would try it.

I like the mixture. I would think they remain fairly even, while maybe giving the jr player the “sense” that the advanced board provides a skill levelling impact.

I may also use it to help during the Gramma matchups.

Respuesta 3:
I think for new players the colored side will help the new player play better the planning a lot of it anyway is done in advance, I think if the two of you keep playing and you're playing the gray side you will after a few games begin to be really effective in using the versatility of the gray side annual consistently then win, the gray side really lets you optimize draft picks and put your order and layout how you want. So you can play, but it's not going to help support more evenly matched games

Respuesta 4:
What I would add to the good comments already made is simply that the grey side does have a caveat: if you don’t plan properly, you can end up « blocking » yourself in the late portion of the game. I’ve seen it a couple of times; the player ends up not being able to put anything in some lines because further placements would be illegal.

We've played this way also to help newbies keep to the guidance of the coloured board.

I personally appreciate playing the main board best so far, but I think we will continue mixing boards during play despite the rules stating otherwise, so the more advanced players can also try the boards from the expansion without forcing younger players to also do so.

We use the plastic covers (cube grids) every game but we've yet to use new boards, enjoying the base one a lot.

Well, technically I believe that if you have blocked yourself on the grey side (or if you are playing on the colored side and the tile available can’t be legally placed in any lines) you still need to take tiles; you just can’t place them and they fall directly on the floor, which means penalties.

It’s the same as if you picked up more tiles than space left on a line.

This being said, once the floor line is full, any excess is sent back to the box and won’t incur you more penalties.

If both players are either blocked or have totally filled their floor line, yes you could call the round over, but if any player can still play and/or one of your floor line is not filled, you carry on.

It can become a strategy where you decide to pick a tile you can’t legally place even though there are multiple ones of another color you could place in order to cause your opponent to have to take more penalties because she can’t legally place them.

You must pick all tiles of the same color either from a factory tile, or from the centre of the table.
Any tiles that you cannot (or don't want to) place on one of your pattern lines, must go to the floor line instead.

OK, so from that link you give, the cubes were wooden, then apparently some newer edition after the pandemic hit has resin cubes.

FWLIW all the sets I've seen (at conventions and one owned by my mother-in-law) have wooden cubes, as far as I recall, but little black cubes work similarly well either way, whether they're wood or resin, so I can't see that it would make much difference or be something I'd personally pay a lot of attention to.

Yes you are right it doesn't really matter.
I was just confused cause I read that thread and thought it would look nice if the little black scoring cubes are the same Material as the Tiles

No, there's no benefit in having the starting player token at the end of the game. In fact it loses you a point.
That helps to set up a nice friction, because for most of the game you are trying to figure out how to beneficially gain the starting player token, whereas at the end you are actively trying to avoid it.

There is no special rule to make the starting player token have value (whether 1 point or otherwise) at the end of the game. Simply apply the usual rules for it in the last round, just as in every previous round:

If you are the first player in this round to pick tiles from the center of the table, also take the starting player marker and place it onto the leftmost free space of your floor line.

We play regular 2P games where whoever finishes with the token goes first next game. But that’s not a rule.



Tema 105: Azul Automa


Tema 106: Who else doesn't find any satisfaction/reward in Azul, and Welcome To?
Pregunta:
Who else doesn't find any satisfaction/reward in Azul, and Welcome To?

I see how much Azul and Welcome To are praised. I played these two games repeatedly, with players who loved it, and still I couldn't find any interest in playing this game. I felt odd, and kept wondering why, by exploring more and more. I finally had an enlightening conversation with my partner yesterday, realizing how much he gets a sense of satisfaction of organizing the numbers and the tiles, he has that happy dopamine rush that you seek in games and video games. I realized... it made me nothing. I felt nothing. I don't really care. (While in life I love organizing stuff!). Although I did win all games I played...

We also played Isle of cats, and while I had immense satisfaction, a rewarding feeling playing Isle of cats, from reaching the objectives, my partners didn't like them. He prefers having his tile well organized and filling the boats, he hates one that ask for leaving spaces open. I realized I love overarching objective cards (Everdell, Lords of waterdeep, Abyss, etc.), but welcome To objectives cards aren't worth enough for me, to push me toward a new strategy.

Note that it's not about the theme, I do like abstract as much as themed games.

Who else is like me? If so what are your favorite rewarding mechanisms? (I'll look in your profile for sure!)

Respuesta 1:
I purchased Azul as a simple game that would appeal to my family, and tease them to get involved. Normally I like a little more challenging games than them. Although simple, as I find with most, good, abstract strategy games, the challenge is to be able to feel as if you can win consistently, despite some of the luck aspect. Can you intentionally aim to come out on top, with a reasonable strategy, that favours your choices and placements? That's what I look for in these type of games. Yes, they go back and forth fairly regularly ... but can you plan to win consistently? That's the interesting challenge for me. I'm still working on it. I'm still working on   also.

I 100% agree with you on Welcome To . To me, it felt "empty" to play it. It left my collection pretty quick. I also found that roll (or flip) and writes are just not my thing, because I feel similarly about the Clever  series of games.

Now Azul is a different story for me. It is one of my most played games, and my whole family enjoys it. I feel rewarded for seeing patterns or a bigger picture, and I also like that I have to adapt my strategy when the tiles I want get taken from me. I do understand how it could leave you with the same feeling Welcome To  does, it just didn't do that for me.

I like shorter, lighter games, abstracts like Santorini  and Azul, and worker placement/tableau building games like Everdell , Architects of the West Kingdom , and PARKS  that reward you for creating a good system or engine.

You cannot compare Azul and Welcome to... to more complicated game. You have to understand the appeal to play these game comes from their accessibility and player count.

Can you play Everdell with 10 people? With welcome to... , you can.
Can you play Everdell with people who can't read read cards because they're young or don't speak the same language? With Azul you can.

There are no 'Best' games, but there are right games for the right player count and the right accessibility. That's why those games exist. They are for non boardgamers or light gamers. If you want more complicated games, there are tons out there.

Dont wish for a game to be what you want. Play it for what it is and be grateful you can spend time and introduce your hobby with people you like.

Azul is an excellent 2-player game, 10/10 for me. In larger group it is good, but nothing exceptional, 7/10. I don't see Azul leaving my collection anytime soon, it kinda is 2 games in one. I can play it as a brain-burner with my wife or I can introduce new player to gaming with it.
Fun fact, I am decent Azul player (ELO 500 in BGA), but when playing 3-4 player games, I am able to lose to anyone, even if they play their 2nd game.

And yes, if someone claims that Azul doesn't have strategic depth: go to BGA...

A person I know proposed we play this game. She said it had "fiddly bits". I watched the video tutorial posted here on the game in English. The narrator spoke too fast, I had to use the Gear icon to step down his speed to 75 per cent. I got an overwhelming feeling of "Fizzbin" (reference to the made up game from the original star trek episode). "If this, but not when that, and always the other" My assessment is purely emotional, not logical......just a feeling that the game is "fussy". I despise the "gotcha" type games......"you didn't say rumplestiltskin!" vibe.
I like a game that gives me a feeling of control, not one that says "every step of the way, you must do the precisely correct thing, and only that one thing, or you lose"

I had a mild epiphany. My friend has stated that she has Asperger's Syndrome. I find this aspect of her frequently obnoxious. I cannot speak a single sentence without her disagreeing/correcting in some way. I don't mean grammar. Example: I might say, "Your friend from school called," and she asks "Who?" "Andrea". And she HAS to correct me, and the corrections are ALWAYS totally irrelevant / petty. "Andrea isn't my friend, she's my study partner." This adds NOTHING to the conversation, and she's oblivious as to how entitled and ridiculous this makes her sound.

She's the type of person who would go as a guest to someone's home, and walk around straightening all of the crooked paintings, without asking permission to do so.

So.....I can sort of anticipate what she likes about this game. It appeals to Aspergers / Obsessive Compulsive disorder.

I sort of have a similar feeling as you but I anticipated this going into the game (just understanding the mechanics from watching gameplay and review videos) but I can see the appeal of this game and bought it to play with some of my family that I know would prefer/enjoy this. I do still see some of the merits of this game and will continue to play it. I also won the 2 games (I just got the game) that I played.
For a similar (but superior in my opinion) game, I recommend Sagrada. The added bonus is that it has a very good solo mode, in addition to similar feel and gameplay for 2-4 player counts (up to 6 if you have the expansion).



Tema 107: Increasing line bonus (2 to 10 VP)
Pregunta:
At the end of the game, instead of having 2 VP per full line, give 2 VP by floor length (1 = top, 5 = bottom).

So at the end when it's full, top line gives 2 VP because it's easy, 2nd line 4 VP, ..., bottom line gives 10 VP

Respuesta 1:
Interesting. What is the aim here? To discourage games ending after five rounds? Most games end, in my experience, after lines one or two get filled in. This normally takes five or six rounds. Unless everyone plays for long lines in this variant, those who do are certain to lose to people ending the game by filling the top lines.

Tema 108: Azul: Simple rules, satisfying strategy, good fun
Pregunta:
My wife bought this for me for Father's day. We are always on the hunt for anything good below the designer level of board game as our children are too young to take on the heavier board games and she has no interest. This one came highly recommended by ProZD and many others, so I was eager to diver into this.

Suffice to say, I was not disappointed in any way.

Right away you notice that despite the simple nature of the game, the components are very good quality. The tiles are simple but aesthetically pleasing, the player boards are good, everything lends to a relaxing, easy to learn board game.

The rules are likewise simple and clean, with the game divided into a number of rounds broken down into two phases each. The first phase as the first player populate the "factories" with four tiles each, determind by the number of players. Players then take turn selecting their tiles of choice to populate the staging side of their board. Herein lies the deceptive depth of strategy in Azul, where you can't merely select these at random, nor can you fully rely on a plan that may well fall apart merely by bad luck on tile draws.

Points are scored by tiles being successfully moved from the staging side of the board into the tile wall. This is done in the second phase for any staging row that has been completely filled up. These rows grow successively larger, with the first row being a single tile, all the way up to five tiles by column five. You need all tiles on a row to match in order for it to be completed, so you may or may not be able to complete your plans based on the amount of available tiles, much less what other players are trying to accomplish on their own boards.

The combinations of the order of operations of each turn, tiling, and scoring both allows and necessitates equal parts planning and flexibility on players' parts. The order of operations is extremely important as two players with very similar end results on their tile wall may have wildly different scores depending on what order those tiles were laid in.

All in all, the game is a great mixture of easy to learn rules (My 7 year old picked it up very quickly), with a good depth of strategy to learn and master. Azul is a great addition to the collection of anyone looking for a more lightweight board game.



Tema 109: Azul....Why it made into my culling list
Pregunta:
The first time I saw it's play through and heard about it bagging the coveted Speil Des Jahres award, I was quite sure I would like this game and immediately purchased it. But alas after around 20-25 plays and almost a year and a half of purchasing I finally decided that it was not working for me and I decided to cull it. I pondered over it and found out that it was probably due to the following :
1. The lacklustre playermats.
I agree that the tiles in this game are eye candy...But I cannot say the same about player boards. The reverse side with grey tile spaces is even more humdrum.
I also feel that the player board ought to have been dual layered so as to prevent the continuous slipping and displacement of tiles.

2. The lousy score track
This is perhaps my biggest pet peeves. It is so easy to place your marker on a wrong score box since there are no numerals on score boxes except after every 5 points.. The score track ought to have been dual layered also since the marker seems to be precariously placed on it and if you happen to mistakenly displace it in game then there is no way to recalculate the ongoing score

3. Sluggishness of initial rounds.
The game usually extends over 5-6 rounds and the initial 2 rounds are always very slow and low scoring and it is actually by the end of 3rd round that you start to feel the thrill of chaining combos and actually enjoying the nail biting moments.

4. Lacklustre theme
I understand that this is an abstract game but my argument is that if the designer were able to craft a story explaining the background setting if the game , surely they could have added some more themetically relevant game pieces or artwork for a more immersive experience.

5. Not as good at 2player count.
The game plays ok at 2 player count but it actually at 3player where it shines IMO. I didnt have the previlege of a 3rd player and have mostly played a 2 player game...While experiencing 3player games mostly at board game arena.
I now enjoy an occassional game at BGA only and thus git rid off my physical copy altogether.

My post may have miffed azul afficionados and i aplogise for that in advance but i do want to hear the thoughts of supporters and critics both .
Thanks for reading and responding

Agreed. My "defense" of Azul would be that it's simple enough to be taught to non-games, but has ample depth for repeat plays, and I don't really lament that I don't feel sufficiently like a Portugeuse tile-layer -- it's just not something I'm looking for in an abstract game, any more than I've really fantasized about myself as a battlefield commander when playing chess.

Respuesta 3:
I will agree on one point.... The scoring track is very susceptible to bumping. I'd rather like to see way to keep track via a dual layer card like in Terraforming Mars Ares with a tens and ones track. That would also then cut the top of the main board and allow for a significantly smaller box since the L/W is determined by the player boards with integrated score track.

Respuesta 4:
Regarding the comments about dual-layered boards and scoring tracks, the   expansion comes with overlays for the player mats that prevent the tiles and cubes from being easily dislodged.

This is your biggest reason to sell the game? Whilst the score tracks were a terrible design choice, they don't make the game bad. Just ignore them and write scores on a piece of paper. Azul is an excellent game; a keeper.

Respuesta 6:
Hi sharat

Opinions are opinions and games don't fit everyone tastes. Just as an example, I think Azul is best at 2p, is the more strategic player count for me. And I think the initial 2 rounds are as important as the later ones because you are building yourself up (and it is lovely when someone is going ahead of you those two rounds and you just pass by them on scoring after two pieces because you were waiting for those combo-ed pieces).

I do have to admit I cringed with the conversation for dual layered boards. I would like to understand what was the point people got so "spoiled" that feel everything need to have dual layer boards. The game is "cheap" (for some standards) right now; dual layer boards will only, unnecessary, increase its price. They are a premium component and this game is also aimed to a mainstream audience, people who don't care about them... Let's not talk about the extra material needed for it.
I give the scoring track is not the best and things can slide; using a piece of glue rubber (or whatever the name of it is) solves that. The tiles section works perfectly. I got the expansion and tried to play with the overlay and I am doubting if I will use it that many times, to be honest.

For me, the argument "this game ought to have dual layer boards" is right now on the same book of "this game should have gotten minis". No, it doesn't. Games will only get more and more expensive if folks still keep saying this.

I cannot think of a game in which you score during the game and you score more or less stable. It's quite natural in most of the games that you play in a way so that you are able to score more and more. I really don't get this critique.

4. Lacklustre theme
Take it or leave it, it's an abstract, the minute I start playing I forget about the theme at all. I appreciate that the team is original and "beautiful", if it was fantacy or space, I would probably not even try it.

sharat gupta
@hotdoc29
5. Not as good at 2player count.
This is where I strongly disagree. For me Azul shines as 2-player "brutal" duel. I would play in higher player counts, but wouldn't suggest it myself. I'd much rather play something like Sagrada or Cascadia in higher player count. However, if you don't like it in 2, which is totally understandable (the game is cutthroat), I wouldn't try to convince you to keep it. There is a ton of abstract which work as good, or better than Azul, in 3-4 players.

The   Expansion solves the score track and tile bumping issue, if needed. I play at 2 player count, and like it just as well as at 3 & 4.

Instead of a dual layer player board, I would rather have voted to include 4 additional dual sided player mats - shuffle the colour patterns around (apparently   also provides this), or change up the scoring bonuses. I always like extended playability upgrades, expansions, and rules mods.

  has some good additional depth, and replayability for the next level of gamers in our group.

Respuesta 12:
E Ghogg, Queen'sGarden is interesting. Most playthroughs of this game on youtube have been done incorrectly. There are some convoluted rules (the way they are written) that left people interpreting them different ways. I like it, but haven't found a strategy to get a decent amount of points. I'm hoping eventually, someone will do video on strategy for the game. It's a bit addictive because I continue to want to try to get a better score. I haven't played Sintra, because it isn't as visually appealing, but own all the others.

Respuesta 13:
Yeah - if you don’t like it, then you don’t like it and that’s fine.

I find the components (well, specifically the tiles) to be good value for money. Yes, dual layer boards could work, but wouldn’t affect my enjoyment of the game in any significant way and would add unnecessary costs.

It’s a quick abstract strategy puzzle - having an immersive theme isn’t at all relevant to my enjoyment of the game.

The strongest element of the gameplay is the competitive draft where the tension is just as much about disadvantaging your opponent as it is about benefitting yourself. This means that (again, for me) the game excels at, and only really works at, 2 players. If you prefer it at higher player counts, then that may be indicative of why it isn’t a game system that you enjoy



Tema 110: Intentional Flooring - Accidental Illegal
Pregunta:
When responding, please clarify if answering question A or B. Thanks in advance...

QUESTION A
----
Can you intentionally throw tiles onto the Floor Line?

Example: player has the 5th line open, they really wanted to put blue there, but there's only 1 red tile in the middle. So they want to toss the red tile on the floor and hope for next round.


QUESTION B
----
Trust me when i say this is possible. I don't want to try reverse engineering how it happened...

But when you're playing on the blank side, i found out it's possible to legally fill out a row (namely with intent of filling in the last space of that row), but then when it comes time to scoring it turns out this is no longer a valid move (due to the nature of filing in the line top to bottom).

In this rare edge case, would all the tiles of the "suddenly illegal row" get thrown onto the floor?


Thanks in advance

Tema 111: I can see why the universal praise, but for me...
Pregunta:
The so well beloved and popular Azul, a favourite of the masses. Being a Portuguese myself I do get the theme and its historical placement, despite the fact the game should’ve probably been called Azulejo (tile) instead of Azul (colour blue) - I’m sure along the way someone had to make an executive decision on keeping the name short and sweet. Let’s just get this out of the way immediately: it is a great game and you will very likely love it, despite my review. At its heart it’s an abstract pattern building/tile placing game, not hard to teach and get going from the first play. It is a better and more engaging play with more than 2 people, but still perfectly fine if that’s all you have. There are no rough edges here, only a superior distillation of raw gaming elements - everything feels like an elegant minimalist design, function married with form. And still… despite all this and contrary to what is the general opinion, I can’t bring myself to say I love it: it’s just too minimalist and abstract for me - I just don’t fully connect with it. As silly as it may sound, it feels like I’m playing a bit of tiling Soduku. Don’t get me wrong, this is a great little abstract affair, perhaps one of the best around, but me I guess I prefer a bit more meat around the bones of my board game experience. I should always be up for a bit of Azul, but there will probably always be something else around that will connect a little bit more with me.

Pedro I feel the same way. I was given Azul as a gift several years ago. I appreciate the simplicity and the aesthetics of the game. The tiles are really nice in a tactile way, and aurally when they clink together. Also, there is a fair amount of depth to the game that is revealed with increasing plays. So it definitely has some positive attributes. Do you really want to play it? Ok, I am happy to oblige. However, I never seem to be excited to play it. My enthusiasm for the game is forever lukewarm.

Azul isn’t my favourite game so I don’t really fault you overall, but this specific point is completely wrong. (Sorry!) As a three or four-person game it’s fine — very gentle, very calm, not much to it. As a two-person game, played properly it is intense and cut-throat and strategic.

To see why, and to see why Azul is better than Stained Glass or Summer Pavilion, I recommend this post by the great qwertymartin: https://boardgamegeek.com/blogpost/100408/tale-two-azuls-wha...

Also worth listening to the Decision Space podcast, which has a great discussion of the depths of the 2-player game.

Just out of curiosity, what are your thoughts on cooperative games? I find those have a lot of satisfying interaction, too. Player interaction is definitely an important part of game design and one can prefer constructive interaction or destructive interaction. Some people prefer only the destructive kind, and that's okay.

I have found that if someone prioritizes making life difficult for their opponent in a 2p game, said player tends not to score that well (I've tried it, actually). I think the best strategy is to focus on your own tableau first, and then once there is little that can be done with your own board for the round, only then does the focus shift to depriving your opponent.

However, if your opponent in a 2p game is extremely sensitive to 'take-that' mechanics, it might still be too much? It's actually really hard to find competitive games that minimize the 'take that' aspect.

In any case, it's interesting how one's perception of another's responsibility can change when the player count changes. Someone can feel that the other player is intentionally taking away the pieces that they wanted more strongly in a 2p game of Azul than a 4p game, even if there is nothing preventing the players in the 4p game from doing the exact same thing.

Tema 114: HELP! Questionable rule?
Pregunta:
My wife and I were playing Azul last night. The game was nearing the end with four of the five horizontal rows filled out. We were both tired and my wife inadvertently placed a Red tile on the top (single) Factory space, however she already had a Red tile on that horizontal line and neither of us noticed until it was time to divy up points, at which point we both noticed. She wanted to replace the tile with a Blue one from the bag stating there was no rule for what to do in a situation like this, and since it was an honest mistake she should be allowed to place a tile she would have placed anyway. I thought the Red tile should go down to her floor, since it was what was left of the tiles on the board. She did not like this since she already had the "1* and ate another colored tile and did she did not think it was fair for her to eat an additional -2 for an honest mistake. We ended up quitting our game due to our disagreement. So what do you guys think is the appropriate way to handle this situation?

Respuesta 1:
Hey, it’s your marriage, so there’s more here than the game. But if I had made that honest mistake, I’d offer to do as you suggested, and if my opponent made that honest mistake and offered to do that, I’d say it was too late to correct the mistake, we both missed it, and leave the tile where it is.

Respuesta 2:
In that situation I think I'd suggest a compromise - discard the red tile to the bag but don't replace it. In all likelihood your scores will not be within 2 points of each others so whether it's placed on the floor or not is probably irrelevant, but replacing the red with a blue tile from the bag and allowing it to be placed on the 'wall' could yield enough points to change the result. That wouldn't be 'fair' unless you could re-trace all your moves back to when the honest mistake happened and replay from that point. If there was still insistence from your wife to allow the blue to be played, personally I'd yield to maintain the peace and the opportunity for a rematch.

I think there is a rule that deals with a situation like this:



The red tile cannot be placed according to the rules, so it must go to the floor line.

She accidentally broke the rules, and game rules necessarily suppose you're following the rules and generally don't include rules about what to do when you break the rules: after all, there are endlessly many ways you can accidentally break rules in a game. E.g. similarly there's no rule covering what you should do if someone accidentally gives themselves an extra point they shouldn't have gotten, or if someone accidentally doesn't take all the tiles of one color when they take tiles from the center, or etc etc.

It's ultimately up to players to decide how strict/harsh or lenient they want to be when it's discovered that someone mistakenly broke a rule in a game and how to resolve the illegal move after it's discovered.

She accidentally broke the rules, and game rules necessarily suppose you're following the rules and generally don't include rules about what to do when you break the rules: after all, there are endlessly many ways you can accidentally break rules in a game. E.g. similarly there's no rule covering what you should do if someone accidentally gives themselves an extra point they shouldn't have gotten, or if someone accidentally doesn't take all the tiles of one color when they take tiles from the center, or etc etc.

It's ultimately up to players to decide how strict/harsh or lenient they want to be when it's discovered that someone mistakenly broke a rule in a game and how to resolve the illegal move after it's discovered.

The game was nearing the end with four of the five horizontal rows filled out.
This indeed sounds suspiciously like you misunderstood how the game ends. If 4 horizontal rows were filled out, the game should have already been over.
I believe the OP means the left ‘rows’ that you play tiles into, not the ‘rows’ that you move a tile across at the end of a round if a left ‘row’ is fully populated.

Respuesta 8:
If I recall properly, there is a line in the rules stating exactly what to do when someone does a mistake like that. Those "mistaken" tiles go to the floor line.

Respuesta 9:
About the only relevant part of the rules for this is in the Floor Line section which states:
"Any tiles you have picked that you cannot or do not want to place according to the rules, you must place in your floor line, filling its spaces from left to right."

Later on after play, it was noticed that they had a colored tile on a pattern line that was not allowed to have been placed there. That incorrect tile cannot be placed there according to the rules, so it must be placed in the floor line instead.

Thank you everyone for all the replies! I really appreciate it! A few comments got me thinking of spirit of the law vs letter of the law and I think I should have been more considerate about letting her remove the Red tile to the bag.

And as many pointed out and a few of you surmised correctly, I accidentally said "rows" when I meant to type "tiles"... Or rather: "four of the five horizontal tiles of the row filled out." Hope that clears things up.

Lol absolutely! What makes it even more egregious is I was beating her by a solid 15-points and neither of us had all colors but I already had a vertical row and she didn't so I would have won regardless. I should have let her take the tile away to the bag. Lesson learned.

Tema 118: Azul Strategy Guide from a 600 ELO player
Pregunta:
Hi everyone.

Azul is one of my top three favourite board games and since coming out on Board Game Arena is my most played board game. When it first came out I got as high as rank 6 on the website, but after taking a break for a few months and playing again recently I'm sitting around the top 100.

Compared to all the other strategy guides I've made I found Azul to be the hardest to give tips for without sounding too generic and non-helpful. So I've included some examples of situations where I can use these tips in action and hopefully illustrate the points better. While I'm sure there's nothing revolutionary in this guide I hope it can help people with the thought process behind taking tiles and what to prioritise when deciding what to take.

I mention those only to substantiate that I have a lot of experience - Azul was my most played game of 2020. About a year ago I started writing my own strategy guide for two-player Azul - it was point-for-point nearly identical to what you've presented here, so I'm glad to see that a higher-level player came to the same conclusions that I did.

This morning I won again. I'm psyched!



Tema 119: What would be a cool subtitle for the original Azul?
Pregunta:
All the Azuls have a subtitle except the first one and now people have to use the gross phrases like “original azul” or “og azul”.

With ticket to ride you can tell they mean the original as people say “TTR: USA” to refer to the original one now.

I feel like for such a great game it deserves a classy name to refer to the original outside of the four letter family

(Having said that Pandemic does get away with it and so does Catan ).

Maybe “azul: tile factory” or the “tiles of Lisbon” or a better geographical marker.

Tema 120: Completing, or attempting the bottom row first?

Better move so you don't get blocked in a s in a subsequent row, thus less chance of gathering floor tiles?

Respuesta 1:
In my experience (mostly 2P games), the opposite. Larger groups of tiles are more likely closer to the end of a round. It’s better to leave the 5 and 4 rows empty for as long as you can so you are not forced to take 4-5 tiles into rows 1-3.

If you are drafting tiles to avoid having 4-5+ tiles get grouped together in the middle, I wonder if you are leaving too many good options for your opponent and allowing them to score a lot of round-to-round placement points.

In addition to taking what’s ‘best’ for our own boards in the 2nd half of the game we might actively draw to leave 5+ of a colour in the middle that the opponent cannot place in the bottom 2 rows and then move certain colours into the middle to leave the right number of different colours there in order that the other has to take multiple negative points. Populating the bottom rows early with multiple colours potentially leaves us exposed to higher negative points if the other succeeds in doing this.

Respuesta 5:
I try to leave either 4 or 5 until later in the round, to protect if needed, or to swoop if a big group of one colour materializes. Otherwise I’m aiming to fill verticals while lining up a few matching horizontals for scoring doubles.

Tema 125: Azul, my darling - A Cheerful Meeple review
Pregunta:
This review was originally published on thecheerfulmeeple.com!

Note: I won't explain the rules in this review.

I was recently looking at my BG Stats app (the next level geekiness tool for board gamers that replaced my traditional spreadsheet) to figure out my most played game of all time. While the number one game is, without a doubt, Android Netrunner, the second place did not come as much of a surprise either. And funnily enough, it is not one of my favourite games. I am not even sure if it is a top ten game for me. But there is an undeniable reason why Azul is my most-player non-ANR game. It is my partner's favourite game.

Board gaming, at least the non-solo variant, is a universe of compromise. The first part of every board game interaction begins with choosing a game. And what you want to play may, of course, not be what the other people involved want to play. That situation happens quite often when I show up at a gaming event with 4-5 games, ending up maybe playing one of them, most often none. But gaming as a couple can be an even trickier affair, especially when the other member of the said couple is not as much of a gamer as you are.

So what do you do when you feel like playing a game, especially on a weeknight? You pick a safe bet. A game with simple rules you won't have to teach. A game that won't take more than fifteen minutes to set up and that still provides game satisfaction. And oh boy, does Azul hit the mark there.

Click-clack said the tiles!
Someone I can't remember has described Azul as a masterclass in good game component design. Make sure the critical components (in this case, the tiles and the bag) are high-quality and beautiful and compromise on the less important bits (the plates, the boards) so that your production costs remain reasonable. I cannot agree more here. The tiles are perfectly weighted and make this oh-so-satisfying clicking sound when you manipulate them. I always give the bag an extra shuffle with my hand when we play to feel the tiles. It's great.

And it's that beautiful table presence that attracted my partner to it during a games night in Tasmania. She sat down at the table, someone read the rules (wrong, I must say), and she played a four-player game and won. So when Valentine's Day came around, I gifted her Azul.

Ever since, we have played 29 games of Azul, with most of them at two players. This game has evolved with us.

An evolving game
"Um... what now? How is Azul an evolving game," I hear you say? No, it does not have a legacy version. There is a second board on the back with no assigned colours for the tiles, but we rarely use that one. I even got the expansion for it, but the tile inserts are terrible (I guess they forgot the component lesson there), and the new boards are ok at best.

No, Azul is an evolving game because of the way your play style will evolve with time.
During your first couple of plays, you stumble around a bit. You try to see where you can place your tiles but miss some opportunities or good placements. You're not sure how to score, so you double-check the rulebook for that. But that's ok because your opponents do the same. You all stumble to a mid-sixties score (or maybe less, and that's ok), and you say, "ok, I think we have figured out this game".

And then you become good. You become efficient. You spot the excellent plays. You score columns, your tile-picking timing improves. You score one, even two "five-of-a-kind"! After around ten-fifteen plays, your scores are soaring. My high score at Azul? 132. No idea how it turned out so good, but that was a while ago. Something has changed since then. Something drastic.

A bloody mean game
Somewhere down the "path of glory" of your high-scoring games days, one player will look up from their board. They will see the tiles you need, but that won't harm their game either. And they will take them. The euro-game fan in you will look up in shock horror. "How dare you?" you will say. A line has been crossed. This abstract, high-efficiency game is suddenly becoming a tile-laying war game, where blocking an opportunity is as important as picking the right tiles for yourself and where you need to pay attention. You will be back scoring in the sixties-to-eighties range and finish the game slightly exhausted from the mental effort. Azul is still a light game because of the simple ruleset (except maybe the scoring, which takes a few games to grasp), but it is now a puzzle, just like playing Tetris against an opponent.

I did say Azul is not in my top ten favourite games earlier, but it is in my top gaming experiences when playing against my partner. I'm not a fan of abstract games, and my favourites will always be more complex and thematic euros. But Azul will never leave our collection.



Tema 126: mind the gap
Pregunta:
today, after a bunch of games, i noticed one thing for the first time

if your first 3 tiles fall in a column, like this



(assume one in each round

the way to maximize scoring is to not have a gap, i.e. put 2 first, or do 123 or 321, to get 6vps, 1+2+3


1vp


2vp





3vp

= 1+2+3 = 6vps

if you do leave a gap, you only score 5vps
1vp





1vp


3vp

1+1+3=5vps


BUT if you wanted to put them in a corner shape, like this



first place in position 1
1 vp


then place in position 3

1vp

then place in position 2

4vp

1+1+4 = 6 vps

because if you start with the "middle" like before, you only score 5vps!



=1vp

2vp



2vp
1+2+2 = 5

Well,

this is a good way to score.
Personally I din't go with a predefined strategy, I prefer ti change as the game does too.

But in my not very deep experience, I think it's very useful to think long term, tryng to hit something like

1 - 5
2 - 10 - 6 - 7
3 - 4
8 - 9

This way you make lot of pts while still reaching fast full columns and maybe one full colour

Respuesta 3:
edited with emojis, i think its easier now.

just assume the placements are sequential, in different turns if necessary

ps: this is not about a strategy to win the game, there are clearly more important things than how to order the placement of specific pieces.
its just about something that i took as a good rule to follow "try not to leave gaps between the pieces", but it clearly is not the best way to score in all situations, somethimes the gaps increase the reward.

In all, everything that you pick up must go on to one pattern line of your choosing (even if it's full), with any excess falling to the floor.
Or it can go directly to the floor. If you have no valid lines to place any tiles, or if you don't want to place them.

@russ
The rules explicitly say:
Quote:
Then, add the tiles you picked to one of the 5 pattern lines on your player board
with "one" emphasized.
Supplemental quote a few lines later

If you have picked up
more tiles than you can place in your chosen pattern line, you
must place the excess tiles in the floor line (see Floor line).

That's great. Thank you all, much appreciated.



Tema 128: (Resolved) End Game - Horizontal Rows
Pregunta:
The End Game rules state:
"If any player has a horizontal line of 5 tiles on their wall, the game ends after that round."
"The player with the most points wins the game. If there is a tie, the player with more completed horizontal lines wins."

But the first horizontal line that is placed TRIGGERS the end game. How could there be players that have "more than" ONE horizontal line, in order to break the tie?

Respuesta 1:
Because you finish the round.

Respuesta 2:
You can complete more than one horizontal line in the last round of the game. The game only ends after all tiles have been moved over and scored.

That said, I cannot remember a game where we needed that tie breaker.

I've played 2-player Azul multiple hundreds of times and maybe 1 in 50 of my games has been decided by this tie-breaker. When luck of the draw doesn't immediately decide who wins, 2-player Azul can be a super tight game.

I distinctly remember seeing this once - perhaps even twice. I wondered at the time why there were not additional tie-breaking criteria like most columns/colors completed, most end-game points scored, etc. It's such a rare occurrence but having a board game end in a perfect tie is very unsatisfying to me.

I'm glad you called me out on this, because I did exactly what I normally frown on others for doing - I quoted rules from the BGA "How to Play" section rather than the official game rules sheet, as you have done. Either way, I was confused initially, having only read the rules, prior to actually playing the table version of the game (having only played digitally at that point). With a few plays under my belt, I now get it, that any player can potentially complete more than one horizontal row in the last round, thus triggering the end game. Thanks for keeping me honest. To improve my mantra - read the rules, play the game a number of times, then complain (in that order).

I'm still loving Azul and now have acquired  .



Tema 129: BoardgamingParent review of Azul
Pregunta:
We have a wide range of ages and tastes in our family. When it comes to board games, finding that sweet spot between simplicity for our younger kids and depth for our teen and adults can be challenging. Occasionally we come across a game that’s a bit of a surprise package, one that some of us are sceptical about at first but then we all grow to appreciate over time. Azul is one of those games, beautiful, simple, and challenging all in the same package. Read on to find out how it won us over in our in-depth review.

Have you ever yearned to become a tile laying artist decorating the walls of a royal palace? What, no? Ok well what if I told you the tiles were beautiful? Still a no. Ok so maybe the theme in this one won’t get you excited but stick with us because we think the game play is likely to win you over. Let’s explain how it works first.

In Azul you are charged with decorating a Portuguese palace with beautiful tiles. The more tiles you connect the more points are on offer. The winner is the person with the most points after the end game is triggered. The game ends once a player has managed to complete a full horizontal line in their wall space (5 tiles).

Gameplay: Azul is simple but provides strategic depth, just hang in there
Azul wasn’t an immediate hit with our family. We got it about the same time as we got Splendor and it’s fair to say we all gravitated towards Splendor immediately. Unfortunately, this meant that initially at least we didn’t give Azul much attention. Our first few play throughs felt a little frustrating. Learning to play was relatively straight forward and we dutifully decorated our wall areas with beautiful patterns. Unfortunately, our efforts seemed to go unrewarded as we totalled our points each round. We rarely mustered enough points to be proud of and were a little lost as to how to improve.

You see Azul is a little deceptive. It’s such a simple game at its core and the beautiful components make it seem approachable and easy. It is certainly easy to learn but like other notable abstract games, for example Chess, the strategy is anything but simple. The more you play Azul the more you appreciate the depth of thinking required for such a simple game and the way the game evolves over each round.

The opening round presents an abundance of options and opportunities. You have few restrictions to worry about and all spaces are available on your wall. Any coloured tile could work provided you get the right number of tiles. What you don’t realise at first is that every tile placed at the end of the round narrows your options for future rounds. Each colour of tile can only appear once in any vertical or horizontal line.

The later rounds are where you feel more at the mercy of the decisions you made earlier in the game. Your options will continue to narrow as the rounds progress, and each turn will start to feel more tense as you hope key tiles won’t be snapped up before you can get to them. This is where the player interaction starts to become more pronounced as denying other players scoring opportunities can in some instances be more valuable than completing a pattern line for yourself. You begin to ask yourself, is it better to grab those yellow tiles and complete one of my few available pattern lines or should I deny someone else the blue tiles, what will have the biggest impact on the score?

Once you begin to understand this the game makes more sense. You begin to craft strategies to maximise points by clustering your tile laying efforts and denying your opponent tiles when it’s worth while. This is the impressive thing about Azul, it has an amazing amount of strategic depth given its simplicity. It rewards multiple play throughs because of this. Once you have mastered the side of the player board with predefined wall tile patterns, the game provides an additional challenge. You can play with the reverse side of the player boards which do not require you to follow a predefined pattern, this adds some initial freedom to your tiling efforts but also means you need to plan more effectively.

In terms of player numbers, the game scales very well. The number of factories adjusts higher with more players making the game feel enjoyable at 2,3 or 4 players. Turns are very short so down time is minimal even at 4 players.

Although I have said the strategy can be challenging to master, I still think the age rating is reasonable. Our 7-year-old is now very good at Azul, although it took her a few games to understand the nuances. I think the biggest risk introducing younger players to Azul is that they may give up after only a game or two due to the challenge it presents. If they can hang in there for a few games it will become more enjoyable.

Overall Azul offers exceptional game play and strategic depth wrapped in a simple rule set that will make it accessible for a wide age range.
What are some tips for playing Azul?

Here are a few tips that might help you if you do decide to give Azul a try:

• When introducing younger players to Azul we think it’s best to start with one-on-one games until they gain confidence. At higher player counts there are more opponents to keep your eye on and more people to put a spanner in your plans
• The centre of your wall space offers the most potential if populated early. If you have for example the central blue tile in place at the beginning of the game, it offers options all around it to connect further tiles for progressively bigger points
• Look for opportunities to force your opponent to take excess tiles and therefore a points penalty. These opportunities often come up near the end of a round where there may be a large number of one colour of tiles in the centre
• Try to prevent your opponent from taking advantage of large scoring opportunities. If for example you know your opponent is looking for 3 black tiles to connect a large vertical and horizontal sequence, deny them those tiles if you can
• If you have a handy lead in points and you are close to completing a horizontal line, prioritise completing it to end the game that round. While you’re in the lead the best choice is to end the game quickly to avoid the potential of others catching up
• Having one tile in the bottom two pattern lines of your board can force you into selecting the same-coloured tiles in the next round and clog up those spaces. Avoid this if you can.

Components: Simple but beautiful
The components in Azul are simple but of high quality and look striking. The tiles in particular are nice and chunky. The patterns are colourful and nicely finished.

The player boards are well laid out on good quality card and provide nice rule prompts.

Overall, the game components are beautiful, and our kids really enjoy the way the tiles look when they are all laid out on the player boards.

Theme: You could easily forget the theme in Azul
I don’t think anyone in our family really cares about the theme when we are playing Azul. To be fair though it doesn’t really matter, much like other abstract games, it’s the gameplay that shines here not the theme.

Final Thoughts: Beauty, simplicity and depth make Azul a fantastic family game
We are not all sold on Azul, while most of the family really enjoys it, my 10-year-old daughter isn’t really that keen on it. But for the rest of us Azul is a real gem that has grown on us over time to become a game we really enjoy.

Pros
• Rules set is extremely simple and easy to learn
• The depth in gameplay and strategy becomes more apparent the more you play
• As the game progresses tile spaces become more scarce adding some tension to your choices in later rounds
• Having two options on the boards for tile placement provides some nice variation in play
• The components are beautifully produced.

Cons
• The strategy can be hard to get your head around at first and may be frustrating for some
• Like other abstract games the theme isn’t really noticeable.

Tema 130: Component upgrade: Tile Tower (fanmade)
Pregunta:
Hello fellow geeks!
I've tried to make a foldable tile tower, similar to the one found in Azul: Stained Glass of Sintra. I tried to replicate the complex fold and glue pattern at the bottom, but I don't know if I succeeded, because I can't print it and try it out currently (out of yellow ink, so no black-and-white print, I hate home printers).
Here's how it looks like:

DOWNLOAD PDF IN THE FILES SECTION: https://boardgamegeek.com/filepage/235086/azul-tile-tower-fa...


If you have the original tile tower fold for the Sintra tower, please do share, it will save me some trial and error. Also, if you want to try it, there is link to the PDF, the paper you should use is thick A4 cardstock.
Once I test it thoroughly and possibly write a foolproof tutorial on how to print, score, cut, fold and glue it successfully, I'll probably upload it in the files section.
All art used is from the rulebook PDF that's provided in the files section, with only clipping masking and vector effects added. The art belongs to the original artist(s) that made it.

Respuesta 1:

In other news, my ink has almost arrived, and I can test my fold and finalize it.

Respuesta 2:

With only small adjustments, the tile tower is complete and successfully folding and holding all tiles included in the game!
I have finalized the file and will be uploading it to the files section. Will post a link here when and if it gets approved.

Speaking of approval, I'm not sure if I'm not breaking any copyright laws by sharing this. I did read the upload rules here on bgg, and so far as I can see, I'm not really breaking any of them, but then again I'm no lawyer, so if anyone could provide an insight, I'd be grateful. If I'd need to obtain a permission from someone to upload this, then who would that be? The Designer, the artists, or one of the 20-ish publishers? Who holds the copyright to the art inside the rulebook?

@Brandon Akers It does, just like the tower included in Stained Glass of Sintra. And even if it didn't fold (or you don't want to fold it) you can store it in the box, there is enough space.

Tema 131: Rules for the x2 tiles.
Pregunta:
With the x2 squares are they predetermined? So they are considered always that colour for the sake of the gray squares around them?

So the other 4 squares in the row cannot be yellow because the x2 square IS yellow?

Respuesta 1:
For the curious, this is a board from the Crystal Mosaic expansion.

The rules say "you may only place tiles of a matching color on these spaces". They don't say you can't place matching colors in the row or column. So you can do so, but you will block access to the x2 spot.



Tema 132: How many tiles of the same color are allowed to be on one Factory?
Pregunta:
Hi everyone!

Some time ago friend of mine told me that I shouldn't put 3 tiles of the same color to one factory. Only 2 per one factory are allowed. If that happens I need to put redundant to the next factory or back to bag.

I found nothing about that in rulebook, but he said it is kind of well known rule that designer of the game told about that.

Also I have tried Azul on BGA today and I have seen that there were 3 tiles on one factory.

So I am confused at this moment and need your help to understand if it is allowed to put 3 tiles on one factory and if anybody knows about this rule of "max 2 tiles per factory".

Do you mean factory tile? If so, you can end up with 4 tiles of the same color on one of them. There's no rule limiting this. It's possible your friend is playing a house rule / variant and either forgot that it is that, or was taught that way and did not know it. There is nothing in the rules limiting how many of a color of tile can be put on the factory tiles when loading them up.

Others have already answered, but I'll just add that not only is there not a rule limiting the number of same colored tiles, there is a rule allowing any number of same colored tiles, due to the use of "randomly." Three tiles of same color are not often seen and four even less, but it is statistically possible to draw 3 or 4 of the same color when they are drawn randomly. Conversely, removing a (randomly) drawn tile and replacing it with a tile intentionally chosen to not be a certain color is the opposite of random.

So if the game designer really did decide at some point that the game would be better with a max of 2 same-colored tiles, I would think that change would appear in the most current versions of the published rulebooks as well as being a huge point on a FAQ or Errata page on Azul's company's website or something.

Tema 133: Azul un gioco che si rivaluta - Azul a game that re-evaluates itself
Pregunta:
Ita:
Ho giocato ad Azul più e più volte, iniziando ad entusiasmarmi inizialmente mentre giocavo le prime partite. A mano a mano che avanzavo nelle partite la tensione calava e la competitività aveva una parabola discendente piuttosto rapida. Sono arrivato a non badare quasi completamente ai miei avversari soprattutto giocando a 3 o 4 giocatori. Le varianti a griglia grigia, le espansioni ecc, non rendono più entusiasmante l'avventura che rimane invariata, hype iniziale per poi spegnersi nella ripetitività. Ho scoperto anche un metodo vantaggioso per giocare e che spesso mi porta alla vittoria, che viene mitigato con le espansioni.

Sostanzialmente è un bel gioco se lo si prende per qualche partita ogni tanto, ma una volta che si impara il gameplay risulta ripetitivo e poco vario anche nella strategia e soprattutto se le partite si susseguono con lo stesso gruppo, la competitività decresce in modo esponenziale.

Voto finale al gioco? 6,5

Eng:
I've played Azul over and over again, starting to get excited initially as I played the first few games. As I progressed through the games the tension subsided and the competitiveness had a rather rapid downward trend. I have come to almost completely ignore my opponents, especially playing 3 or 4 players. The gray grid variants, the expansions, etc., do not make the adventure that remains unchanged any more exciting, initial hype and then fading into repetition. I also discovered an advantageous method of playing that often leads to victory, which is mitigated with expansions.

Basically it is a good game if you take it for a few games every now and then, but once you learn the gameplay it is repetitive and not very varied even in the strategy and above all if the games follow one another with the same group, the competitiveness decreases exponentially.

Final grade for the game? 6.5

Respuesta 1:
I'm not a huge fan of the game although it certainly achieves what it sets out to do. The drafting is satisfying and whilst the placement of tiles on your own board does become mechanical - aside from a few optimisation decisions - after a while, the one thing I'd disagree about in your review is that you can afford to "almost completely ignore your opponents". I find that my turns are almost always informed - particularly in two player but also in higher player count games - by my opponents boards and their apparent plans.

What are the few exceptions when you do pay attention to your opponents?



Tema 134: Differences between azuls and possible best?
Pregunta:
I'm looking for a new board game to add to my collection, and azul has been really tugging at my interest, however, the more I look into it, the more and more azuls I see, and I want to know what the general gameplay difference between all of them is, if there's a public favorite, or if I should just go for the one that I like the colors and shapes of the most to satisfy the component goblin within me.

Respuesta 1:
Go for the plain version of Azul. It's the best entry, and IMO still the best version, and an excellent game.

Respuesta 2:
The clue to the public favourite is in the Abstracts Ranking.

Respuesta 3:
Original Azul is the shorter, tighter, and more interactive/cutthroat version with a smaller rules overhead.

Sintra is generally considered to be the weakest of the 3 and probably not worth considering.

Summer Pavillion is more forgiving and has more downtime as scoring is done in order instead of simultaneously as in the original. It allows for "combos" which is often considered a plus for most modern gamers that like engine-builders. The tower for the tiles is a very nice addition as far as components go.

Have not played "Queens Garden" yet.

My take:
If you prefer a shorter, interactive, and more to-the-point experience go for the original.
If you like your games a bit more "loose", like combos and want less dependency on the other players then I suggest Summer Pavillion.

Respuesta 4:
I personally like the more combotastic nature of Summer Pavillon, although it plays longer and can drag at times. Classic Azul is very nice and I also like the Crystal Mosaic expansion to add variety and a bit of challenge.

Respuesta 5:
The original is my favorite and is the only one that has an expansion to increase the experience. Check out

Respuesta 6:
Hi Liam,

My favourite is the original one.

Sintra has a more interesting and, in my opinion, cutthroat gameplay. If you appreciate the take-that component, it's the one to go.
I do not like it as much as the original, because of the scoring: it is very unforgiving with mistakes, and that take-that element. This may ruin the experience for some players. And as a "nice family game", that's a no-no for me. Should Sintra not be an "Azul game", my prejudice/opinion may be other.

Summer Pavillion is more strategy-oriented. As others have said, downtime may be an issue, especially if there is an AP-prone player, because at the beginning of the game you are taking long-shot decisions; and when near the endgame, you may be counting every single possible point.

I have not played the Crystal Mosaic expansion nor the fourth Azul.

Happy gaming!
Ivan.

Respuesta 7:
If you have not purchased it yet, I would say get the original Azul and go from there. If you have Board Game Arena, you cna test it there to see it the play is to your liking.

The original is the simplest of the games and introduces you to all the basic mechanisms you would encounter in the other three games in the series. And if you want to change some of the tiles, we do have tile packs you can add on to change up the game a little. There is a list of them available here: https://planbgames.com/next-move

Enjoy the games!



Tema 135: Can everything fit in the mosaic box
Pregunta:
Odd question here: is it physically possible to fit azul and it’s expansion in the expansion box. If I lay it out *perfectly*, could it be done? I’m obsessed with space optimization if that isn’t obvious. If not, could it be done by removing a board or 2? What would it take to achieve maximum compactness in the expansion box? Also, lid lift is unacceptable haha. Thank you!

Respuesta 1:
I do not know the answer to your question since I do not own the expansions. But I like the idea

Respuesta 2:
I am almost sure you can't. I have the game and the expansion and they still take quite some space from the main box (8 boards, plastic lids and tiles).
If you take out boards? Maybe. But I am going to guess you will need to take out at least 4 of them.

Respuesta 3:
No, not possible. The expansion box is full as it is. I doubt you could fit more than maybe a board or two in it but you would have no space for the actual bag with tiles or anything else.

If you take the insert out you may possibly fit everything in the base game box but it is likely also tight.

Nope - incomplete rows neither score nor lose points at the end of the game.

Respuesta 2:
After the round that a horizontal line of 5 was completed, first you do the regular scoring of your board, as you would for every other round. After that it just goes straight to final scoring, which only includes scoring the bonusses for rows, columns and sets of 5.

As was mentioned, no. Those tiles stay there for the next round. This locks you in to finishing off that row eventually and limits flexibility based on the next round.

The only way they come off is when you complete the row. Otherwise, they stay.

The section titled End of the game on page 6 describes several scoring situations. I like to quote rules but in this case no mention at all is made for the incomplete rows. So you may safely conclude that there is nothing else that needs to be done with them (except place them back into the bag for a fresh game start).

Respuesta 5:
Thank you everyone for the replies. This is appreciated.

On reflection, it's almost a shame all those tiles didn't go down to the floor, it would add another aspect / challenge to the game.

Anyway, maybe if I get off my lazy butt and make a game someday, then I can design it anyway I want, but until then..... I remain, making comments from the cheap seats.

You can do that, but that gives a roo great advantage to the player that finishes his row. I think this may unbalance the game. But you can always try it out some time.

Tema 137: Azul's decision space
Pregunta:
Decision Space is a podcast about the decisions in games. Every week my co-host and I settle in and unpack a game and its decisions space, looking at the type of decisions it offers, what shape it takes, and how it makes us feel. This week pulled out our trusty toolkit and got under the hood of Azul.

Azul offers a tight interactive decision space that feels both puzzly but just beyond the cognitive horizon...until that magical inflection moment each round where everything clicks into place. There's a bunch to discuss about Azul’s decision space, in the show we touched on all of these topics:

• The type, feel, clarity, and size of Azul's decision space
• How the decision space shifts based on the player count
• Tempo vs initiative in Azul
• How the game sits just beyond the cognitive horizon until it doesn’t
• The two player boards
• Randomness and affordances for this in the systems
• End game scoring conditions
• Finding your path while narrowing your opponents’ paths
• A bunch more

If you're curious you can have a listen right here on BGG or wherever you listen to podcasts.

I have a few questions about the game's decision space for y'all:

1) What mechanic in Azul is the single most important in shaping the game's decision space?

2) What mechanic or situation offers the most consistently compelling decisions?

3) What about the game and the decisions it offers keeps you coming back? If you're someone who's played Azul countless times but are always happy to see it hit the table again, why do you think that is in terms of its decision space specifically?

Thanks! Really looking forward to delving into the game's decision space with this forum.

Respuesta 1:
Just followed on Spotify!

1) Tile Drafting is the most obvious answer but it’s the thing that makes this game shine. What to take, when to take it, where to take it from, are all huge considerations when playing the game.

2) see number 1

3) the decision/option ratio is it’s main strength. You make 2 ‘simple’ decisions on your turn a) what tiles do you take? And, b) where to place them on your board?, both of which are tightly connected…however, the number of options for each of these decisions can be very large (depending on several factors) and each option can have several unique considerations depending on your own strategy and the plans of other players. In my opinion, this disparity is what elevates this game to being one of the best (a fancy way of saying ‘easy to learn, hard to master’).

Respuesta 2:
Thanks for your thoughtful reply Pete!

Totally agreed that the drafting mechanic is the heart here. It’s so tough to single out any one mechanic in Azul because everything works so well in concert to make it the special and sleek game that it is. I definitely thing the ‘hoppers’ / staging areas deserve a nod too. Adds an extra layer of interesting decisions to the drafting as well.

Love your response to question #3 too! The decision / options ratio is makes every round / turn tremendously rewarding and often rewarding decisions lead to more compelling games in the long run than simply interesting ones.



Tema 138: More than 7 tiles in floor line

Just to clarify - it happened within one round?

Maybe the authors didn't count on someone having that kind of situation.

If there are no other answers, I wouldn't count 2 excess tiles - there is already a lot of negative points for that matter.

Respuesta 2:
Rule reference: page 4 "Floor line":

If all spaces of your floor line are occupied, return any further fallen tiles to the lid of the game box to store them for now.

Respuesta 3:
It is not possible to score more (less?) than the 14 negative points. Any other tiles that fall to the floor don't result in any further penalty.

My son is 31. He might object to being told to drive home part way through a game.

Especially since he had just won El Grande (5 -handed) by 2 points (3 of the 5 players were within 5 points of the winner).

Quote:

Yep, the tiles were the last load in the centre area (having played Azul once, I'm not sure of the terminology) which he had no way of avoiding.

Thank you for your answers, we played it correctly.

Oh and my son also won Azul fairly easily; so maybe he should've been sent home.

Relevant guidance is found on page 3 of the rules.

fallen tiles to the lid of the game box to store them for now.

Respuesta 7:
sometimes it's way more better to take 14 penalty points then let the other player take the tiles that he needs to collect the ten points for having all the tiles in one color + 7 for a colum



Tema 139: How to use Promo/Collector tiles?
Pregunta:
I see these "Collector Tiles" available on Plan B Games' webstore: https://planbgames.com/exclusives

Specifically some green, orange, purple, etc.

While they look nice, I don't understand how one would use them. I assume you replace a specific color in your bag and then use the "Advanced" or gray side of the board?

How do YOU use them?

Respuesta 1:
I use them on the blank side, as you said. I got a second bag from someone on eBay so I can easily swap-out the entire core set when I want to play with the Collector Tiles.

Respuesta 2:
I've seen some bgg user here doing an unboxing of all collector tiles, iirc, she said that she sometimes uses more than five sets of colours during one playthrough

Respuesta 3:
From the website:
Quote:
The Azul Collector [color] Set tiles were designed as a cosmetic alternative to replace an entire set of tiles found in Azul.
So yes, they are intended to simply replace another color.

They are most suited for the "blank" side, but we have also used them on the "normal" side of the board.
When we only replace a single color we play them as a straight up replacement, when playing with multiple collector sets we have used them as "once you place them on a colored space they become that color for you".

Will have to try the variant with more than five sets.



Tema 140: What shape is on the "white" tiles?
Pregunta:
I have played this game with a number of people and when it comes to calling out which pieces a player took the "white" pieces have been called by the shape on them with varying titles given to them. We have never called these pieces white but that seems to be the designation the rules give to the pieces. What is the consensus of the shape printed on this tile?

Top options include: snowflakes or stars

Respuesta 1:
I must confess I don't understand the question. I looked at the official English rules and saw no mention of "white" tiles.

There are five colours - solid blue, solid red, black, orange/yellow (depending on how worn the tiles are!), and light blue.

The light blue have a design on them. We call them snowflakes, except for one of our group who calls them "icicles".

Support me and Buy me a coffee



Het doel van Azul (dat rijmt) is om de meeste punten te scoren. Punten scoor je door eerst tegels te verzamelen en daarna te plaatsen op je muur. Hoe meer tegels er in een rij of kolom liggen, hoe meer punten je krijgt. Het spel is afgelopen zodra een speler op zijn muur één rij heeft gevuld met tegels.

Een ronde bestaat uit 2 fases

1. Tegels verzamelen en ter voorbereiding op je tableau plaatsen
2. Tegels op je muur plaatsen en punten scoren

In je beurt verzamel je tegels, deze pak je óf van de fabrieksschijven, óf vanuit de aflegpot in het midden van de tafel. Op iedere fabrieksschijf liggen vier tegels. Pak je in je beurt van een schijf, dan pak je daarvan alle tegels van dezelfde kleur. (Dit kunnen er maximaal 4 en minimaal 1 zijn) De overige tegels (in andere kleuren) leg je in de aflegpot. Op deze manier komen er steeds meer tegels in de aflegpot terecht. Je kunt er ook voor kiezen om alle tegels van dezelfde kleur uit de aflegpot te pakken. Er worden beurtelings net zolang tegels gepakt totdat alle tegels op zijn.

De tegels die je gepakt hebt leg je op je tableau neer. Er zijn in totaal vijf rijen om tegels neer te leggen, in de eerste rij is er plek voor één tegel, de tweede rij twee tegels, enzovoort. Er mogen alleen dezelfde kleur tegels bij elkaar in een rij liggen. Voor tegels die je niet kwijt kunt op je tableau krijg je minpunten.

Zijn alle tegels gepakt, dan controleert iedere speler welke tegels van zijn tableau naar zijn muur kunnen. Is er een rij volledig gevuld met tegels dan gaat er één tegel uit een rij naar de muur op de daarvoor bestemde plek. Alle andere tegels worden afgelegd. Voor elke tegel die je op je muur plaatst krijg je een punt, liggen er al andere tegels in dezelfde rij of kolom dan krijg je extra punten. Alle tegels in een rij die niet volledig gevuld is blijven liggen. Nu begint de volgende ronde en worden alle fabrieksschijven weer aangevuld. Zijn de tegels op, dan wordt de zak weer gevuld met alle afgelegde tegels.

De spelregels van Azul zijn niet moeilijk en passen zo’n drie A4’tjes. Na 15 minuten lezen had ik door hoe het spel gespeeld wordt. Snap je eenmaal de regels dan is het spel ook zo uit te leggen aan nieuwe spelers.



Conclusie

Azul is een abstract familiespel met een toepasselijk en aantrekkelijk uitziend thema. De spelregels zijn niet moeilijk en het spel is zo uitgelegd aan nieuwe spelers. Je verzamelt gekleurde tegels en probeert deze zo efficiënt mogelijk te plaatsen voor de meeste punten. Zeker mensen die ruimtelijk inzicht hebben en houden van puzzelen gaan Azul leuk vinden, maar voor sommige jonge kinderen kan het spel nog iets te abstract zijn. Ook zal voor de meeste ervaren bordspelers het spel snel eentonig worden omdat er weinig variatie in tactiek zit om het spel te kunnen winnen. Al met al is Azul een leuk spel voor de casual speler die graag een eenvoudig en toegankelijk (familie)spel speelt. Zeker wanneer je een spel zoekt dat ook erg geschikt is om met z’n tweeën te spelen.

Score: (7/10)

Tema 145: BGA Strikes Again...
Pregunta:
BGA is kind of like a board game x-ray. With the ability to play a lot in a short period of time, and stripped of social trappings and tactile pleasures, you really find out which games remain engaging and which just aren't really that fun. Unfortunately, Azul falls into the latter category for me. If you are losing by a good amount, there is no emotionally or intellectually compelling reason to continue. You aren't coming back. No maneuver, however difficult, can turn the tables. It is just a sterile, hopeless slog with no fun tricks to pull off or quixotic bullrushes to scheme (even if they are never going to work).

I've enjoyed Azul in real life, though I've not played a lot. This isn't meant to be an exhaustive analysis, just an impression... but when I've had this feeling playing other games, I rarely pick them up again. I'm interested to hear other people's thoughts - maybe I'm missing something. Obviously some people have played this hundreds and hundreds of times and keep coming back for more. I have games I've played thousands of times on BGA... but I don't think I'll even make it to 20 with Azul.

Respuesta 1:
I've never understood the love fest with AZUL. Twice and done for me. Like, that's it? I get that others love it and I can appreciate the simplicity and design of the game, but there just isn't enough there for me and I fall very much in the medium weight category of gamer, so this should be a huge hit for me.

Sterile is the perfect word for me. It's pretty, and love the tiles, but the game play just doesn't work for me at all. I keep thinking we are playing it wrong. It's a hard pass for me now.

Respuesta 2:
,  ,  , and   were games that fell flat after several plays.

Playing online does give you the opportunity to put in more plays, but it can also expose a game’s depth.

I can’t get enough of  .   and   have really surprised me. I wish BGA had more Feld games.

It also gives you the chance to play games you may not be able to play with certain game groups. One day, I hope to learn some heavier games like   or  .

The fault here is with BGA, not the game. I had the opposite experience with 7 Wonders on BGA, finding no reason to ever play the physical version ever again. BGA got to the heart of what is good about that game, without the hassle of housekeeping. I agree with Martin that Azul's physical attributes lift up the experience of playing it. This would be lost on BGA.

Not really. What I'm saying is that the rules, the social aspects and the aesthetics are all important.

What if I rewrote your statement as "stripped of the rules and mechanisms, you really find out which games remain engaging and which just aren't really that fun"? I don't think it makes much more sense the way round you have it.

Respuesta 7:
It seems to me that a game's rules and mechanisms are clearly more important / essential / primary than its tactile pleasures. Changing to completely different pieces might affect my enjoyment of a game to some degree, but changing the rules themselves clearly makes it a different game (and possibly one I have no interest in playing).

E.g. I like Chess, regardless whether I play with my physical set with carved wooden pieces or play a software version.

I could play Tic-Tac-Toe with my carved wooden Chess pawns, but that would be far less appealing and interesting than playing Chess (whether with my carved wooden pieces, or with software, or with cardboard tokens, or whatever).

Respuesta 8:
That's fair. My quibble is with the idea that a game is only "really that fun" if it's enjoyable purely for its rules, and even without any 'social trappings' or 'tactile pleasures'. That might be true for some games, but it certainly isn't true for all of them.

I don't think anyone could disagree they are all important. But I think the rules and mechanisms are MUCH more important. I love Targi, for instance, but I don't know if there is a single tactile or aesthetic element I really like, and my enjoyment of the interplay with other players doesn't depend on the specific social relationship we share.

Quote:

Yes, that's true. But some games really need lively social interaction to work well, while some don't.

FWIW I love 2 player Azul on BGA. It’s only10 minutes or so and if I get behind by too much, I can just concede and perhaps play again.

Tema 148: Some thoughts on 2-player Azul after 400+ plays.
Pregunta:
I've played Azul at all player counts and I have found it to be best and most interesting with 2. My partner and I logged over 300 plays of the physical game during 2020 alone and I have logged over 100 plays of the BGA adaptation. At my peak ELO, I was #19 in the BGA standings.

There are three scoring battles which occur during each game:

1) Scoring round-to-round (which is underrated)
2) Scoring at game end for complete columns/rows
3) Scoring at game end for complete colors (which is overrated)

I have observed over time that some players undervalue round-to-round scoring when that is usually the biggest source of a player's points over the game. Your goal at the end of the first round should be to have a 3-tile column in the first 3 rows (scoring 6 points). Later this hopefully allows you to finish adjacent 3-tile columns to maximize your round-to-round scoring. The ideal position at the end of the first round is to have that 3-tile column in one of the 3 center columns so that you have flexibility in which direction you expand in future rounds. Getting stuck with a 3-tile column in the 1st or 5th columns can really hurt you after the first round, especially if your opponent can starve you of the colors that you need to expand.

At the same time, you are hoping to fill rows 4 and 5 with colors that fit underneath one or more of these 3-tile columns so that you can further maximize round-to-round scoring while also setting yourself up to complete columns. Finishing a column is great for end-game scoring, but finishing a column from the top down is even better, since you score so many points at the end of each round in the process.

These strategy observations are all probably very straightforward and obvious. I guess this is the nature of playing games repeatedly, but... I think I've come to the conclusion that Azul is a total luck fest when played between equally skilled players. The tile distribution in a given round can so heavily favor one player over the other that it feels unnecessary to finish the game. I have even felt this way on some occasions when I see the initial tile distribution and I am the second player: if I can see that the first player will be able to finish a 3-tile column in one of the 3 center columns and that I will not be able to, then I know that I will likely be behind on round-to-round scoring for the rest of the game. The ability of the tile distribution to warp a game is especially significant if the game goes to round 6 - the winner of a round 6+ game of Azul feels invariably deterministic. Games that end after 5 rounds can sometimes be tight and within 5-10 points, but round 6+ games always have landslide final scores.

It's been a blast getting to this point and really digging into this game. The number of games that have yielded 400+ plays is very slim and I'm grateful for Azul to have provided that. But after getting burned by one too many unfavorable tile distributions, I think I'm ready to move on to something else.

We've played both of these at least twenty times since acquiring them. Stained Glass of Sintra is still bad, but Summer Pavilion is great. Summer Pavilion will be my go-to request for Azul games until Queen's Garden is available in the US.

You try to compare two uncomparable games.
One is random every time, depending on the tiles drawn, and usually lasts small number of moves and rounds. Calculable within each round, but not overall
The other is open knowledge, every starting position is equal, even the set-ups of players are equal, it lasts a considerable number of rounds where "first move" advantage slowly dissipates.
Also, let's not forget that you quote chess grandmaster who is proficient at kicking opponent's ass.
If you imagine true ideal game between two ideal opponents, it should always end more or less the same.
Here, since the setup is different every time, luck favours much more.

What makes it bad for me is the random board layout in addition to the random tile distribution. There are often situations where you simply cannot place a particular color on your current board so you either have to concede a very favorable tile draft to your opponent or you get stuck with breaking a large of number of tiles. In Stained Glass of Sintra, breaking tiles is far more punishing than in the other games, because the point cost of breaking them does not reset from round-to-round (as in Azul) and it does not remain constant (as in Summer Pavilion). Luck has the capacity to influence games of Azul and Summer Pavilion, but in Stained Glass of Sintra there seems to have been a design choice to force luck to have a major impact on games.

My partner likes this additional luck factor and Stained Glass of Sintra is her favorite Azul, ergo we have played it twenty times.

I agree about Chess. However, if Mr. Bogolyubov had played Azul, I would have expected him to make the same statement about his play at that game. The difference would only be the length of the match. How does one determine 'equally skilled' except to play the game? Professional Poker players don't win every game but they still make a living, because they're more skilled. To my mind, the question here is "How many games are required to make a determination of superior skill?" Even Chess plays 14 games to determine a World Champion.
Moving on from any game that doesn't entertain you is the way to go. I guess that if one plays 500 games of Azul or Chess against an "equally skilled opponent" I would expect to win about half. In that regard, I don't see a great difference. In either case, if I win more than half, I'd call myself a superior player, not lucky. I don't think of myself as a 'lucky' Backgammon player; I think of my opponents as 'unlucky'.

I played Twilight Struggle 20 more times than I wanted in order to please my wife and main bg partner and hoping this would open windows of opportunities for other games. Love (of humans and of boardgames) makes you do surprising things. Totally worth it.

Azul is an excellent relaxing game btw, and a favorite of ours (around 200 games and still going strong during family vacations). Never played Stained glass and won't buy it based on this thread confirming my concerns. Still want to try it at a bg coffee near me though!

Yup, you're right in the way that luck doesn't become a determinating factor until you become proficient enough.
Of course, the more you play, the more of a badass you become (and that's what I meant by mentioning that Bogolyubov was a grandmaster.

If your skill (number of plays, the ability to calculate, knowledge of some tricks and combinations, etc.) is considerably greater than mine, you will win against unlucky odds in the vast majority of games. If our knowledge is more or less the same (we can both be noobs, amateurs or hardcore professionals), the luck is the determing factor.

This statement resonated with me very much and I laughed out loud reading it. While my partner and I have similar tastes in games my son always seems to want to play Forbidden Island, a game I just don't like, but play for his sake. Thankfully Alien: Fate of the Nostromo has distracted him and is a game I actually enjoy (in no small part thanks to the theme).

Thanks for sharing your experience with Azul, it's such a wonderful game and has been a rousing success with our non-gamer family every time. Have you tried Sagrada? It is a great little brain burning puzzle which my partner loves. It still has a lot of luck since, like Azul, your drawing your dice pool blind in addition to rolling them, but it adds some tools you can use to mitigate some of that luck. Plus each player board is different so you're rarely vying for the same colour or value dice. It's a very satisfying game at 2 and plays fairly quickly.

Sure, they've proven they are more skilled for that game through their superior play. But what happens when they lose the next game to same player? Did they go from equally skilled to more skilled to less skilled? The way that most people use the term *equally skilled* indicates they belong to a skill class that isn't affected by the results of any individual game. Otherwise there would never be any equally skilled players.

I think your original statement is correct if equally skilled means identically skilled, like two computer players. But for any game of sufficient complexity, any two *equally skilled* players (as determined by ranking, ratings, won-lost record, metrics, observation) may vary wildly in their strengths, weaknesses and methods. The results of a game between two such players is of course going to be colored by luck, but I think we all find games of skill more satisfying when victory between strong players is determined by one player making the better play.



Tema 149: Azul: A cozy tactile game
Pregunta:
Azul
Makers/Creators: Next Move Games & Plan B Games
Players: 2-4
Age: 8+
Play Time: 20-30 mins

Synopsis: Azul is a tile drafting and laying game where you are collecting pattern tiles and decorating your palace walls. The game plays in two phases:
1. A drafting phase where you take turns choosing the pattern tiles to put on your board to make complete pattern lines.
2. A placement phase where you move a pattern tile to your palace wall for every complete pattern line you have.
You score points along the way when you place the tiles. Once someone has 1 completed horizontal line on their palace wall the game ends and final scoring takes place. The person with the most points wins.

Review: Patrick and I tested this game out when we were on vacation and I loved it. Not only is the game visually beautiful but it plays quickly. The mechanics are pretty simple and once you get playing the repetition of the turns makes it move quickly. I love the design of decorating your palace walls and how the points are scored. I also like that there is strategy to it because otherwise tiles end up on the floor and can negatively affect your score. We played this with our son too and he had a blast playing it. So even younger players can pick it up and play. I definitely want to add the additional games to my collection because these are honestly just fun beautiful games. It’s one I wanted to try for a while and I am so glad I did!



Tema 150: Possible Counterfeit Azul?

Another common thing for fake Azuls is to include the Joker tiles in the base game.

Tema 152: Player interaction across Azul family of games
Pregunta:
Azul is one of my family's favorite games and I'm looking to get one of the newer ones in the series:

* Azul: Stained Glass of Sintra (2018)
* Azul: Summer Pavilion (2019)
* Azul: Queen's Garden (2021)

We do like the level of player interaction we see in the original Azul and, from what I am reading, I am a bit worried that this may have been tapered down significantly in the newer games in the series.

I'm looking for some insights on the relative presence of player interaction across these games, including how predominant or not "take-that" is.

(Look, we all know that this is a matter of personal/group preference. Different type and levels of "player interaction" may work better for certain groups than for others.

I'm quite convinced that between two equally skilled players, Azul can be a surprisingly luck-dependent game. Whoever gets the right tiles at the right time has a massive advantage. This is somewhat true:

1) At the very start of the game if only one player can complete a three-level column, because their end-of-round scoring tends to accumulates more quickly.

and especially

2) If the game does not end after the 5th round. Almost invariably the player who gets the more favorable tile distribution in round 6 just runs away with the game.

I've thought of hosting 2-player Azul tournaments before and I think if I ever do that I will enforce a variant where the game ends at the end of the 5th round, no matter what.

What makes Azul not abstract in your opinion?

At any rate, to the original question - I'm always going to think that Go and Chess are the greatest abstract games of all time simply because of how deeply they have been and always will be studied (though I am personally more partial to Chess as a Westerner who has been playing my entire life).

But the accessibility of Azul's simple rules combined with the depth of its gameplay absolutely merit the #1 abstract spot on BGG. I think about this occasionally - I don't... really know if anything will ever be able to topple Azul from that position, though that's likely a naive stance. If a game ever does come along to take away Azul's crown, I'll be extremely excited to play it.

If your definition is that an abstract is themeless, well, Azul has a theme and fairly representational art of traditional Portuguese tiles.

If your definition is that an abstract is a combinatorial game (no randomness and no hidden info), well, Azul has randomness.

Chess and Go are "lifestyle games", meaning that playing one of those games is a hobby in and of itself. These games do have representation on BGG, but they are really more niche games that exist as enclaves within the larger hobby. They have such dedicated communities, that BGG isn't really a useful resource for them.

Azul is not a lifestyle game and fits much better under the BGG umbrella. As I said in my last post, Azul is a very accessible game. For those reasons, it is much more appropriate for a game like Azul to sit in BGG's #1 abstract spot as opposed to something like Chess or Go.

That's just flavor text. The theme of Azul is not necessary for the game to function mechanically. If a publisher released a version of Chess whose rulebook included a blurb about "marching along the battlefield to capture the enemy king", would that rendition of Chess not be an abstract game?

Agreed. The whole thing about king Manuel I, on a visit to the Alhambra palace in Southern Spain, being mesmerized by the stunning beauty of the Moorish decorative tiles, and us being a tile laying artist, being asked to embellish the walls of the Royal Palace of Evora. is not an abstract thing.
The theme of Azul is not necessary for the game to function mechanically.
Surely, this cannot be the criterion you think defines an abstract game. This would render almost literally every single game an abstract game.

If you think Go and Chess are the greatest abstract games of all time, then why would you think that Azul merits the #1 abstract spot? Why would a game that is not greatest deserve #1 instead of a game that is greatest?
Chess and Go are "lifestyle games", meaning that playing one of those games is a hobby in and of itself. These games do have representation on BGG, but they are really more niche games that exist as enclaves within the larger hobby. They have such dedicated communities, that BGG isn't really a useful resource for them.

Azul is not a lifestyle game and fits much better under the BGG umbrella. As I said in my last post, Azul is a very accessible game. For those reasons, it is much more appropriate for a game like Azul to sit in BGG's #1 abstract spot as opposed to something like Chess or Go.
I don't buy that notion that it's not possible to play Go or Chess casually. My wife and I play Chess casually, no differently than we play other "more BGG-style" games like Azul.

Look at it this way: suppose a population of Azul fans started studying Azul seriously and playing it seriously, like the population of serious Chess players. Would that make you say Azul no longer deserves to be #1? Would casual players no longer be able to enjoy Azul, just because somewhere else some other people are playing Azul more seriously?

The meaning of the term "abstract game" has bloated since the hobby has become more mainstream but a lack of dependency between theme and mechanisms is the classical definition of the term. My point here was that the flavor text describing tile placement as "embellishing the palace walls" is not sufficient to exclude Azul from being an abstract game.

Azul does not have the same level of depth as Chess. So a population of folks studying Azul as deeply as another population studying Chess is not possible.

You can certainly play Chess casually, but Casual Chess is not the greatest abstract game of all time. The oceanic depth of Chess is what makes it so timeless - but it's also what makes it less accessible for newer players as evidenced by its rank (which is community-driven).

Chess is accessible. Little kids can learn to play Chess, and many enjoy playing it. Just because depth is there does not mean one has to seriously plumb the depths to enjoy something. (Just as e.g. many people enjoy wading at a beach or swimming on the surface without going to the trouble of serious scuba diving... )

Also, I would be leery of mistaking the specific "shiny modern" tastes of mainstream BGG users with humanity as a whole. I would bet that far more people on Earth play Chess casually than play Azul (casually or seriously).

Respuesta 20:
Abstract game- An abstract strategy game is a strategy game that minimizes luck and does not rely on a theme. Almost all abstract strategy games will conform to the strictest definition of: a gameboard, card, or tile game in which there is no hidden information, no non-deterministic elements (such as shuffled cards or dice rolls), and (usually) two players or teams taking a finite number of alternating turns.

https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgamesubdomain/4666/abstract-g...

I guess it really does come down to whether you believe Azul relies on a theme or not.
When I think of more modern "abstract" games, I think Ingenious, Splendor, or Go.
My method of determing whether the game requires a theme is whether I epxplain the context of the game before going through the rules to new players.
That is, in Agricola we are farmers. In Container, we are shipping/logistics capitalists.
In Ingenious, ???. In Splendor, we collect gems for points (but I don't know why or why the pictures on the cards are what they are). In Go ??.

In Azul, I do tend to describe the game in terms of creating a mosaic (and waste on the cutting floor).

Tema 155: What is your highest score?

Another interesting question--what is the highest score possible?
Well, let's picture ideal situation.

You place all tiles in one column, which yields 1+2+3+4+5=15 points. Next, you fill up all the other columns, netting 15 points for each vertical line (15*5). Also, starting from the second vertical line, you get 2*5, 3*5, 4*5 and 5*5 points for each horizontal line after tile is placed. The game ends after at least one horizontal line is finished, suppose we finish all five at the same time.
Then, from tile placement only we get 15*5+2*5+3*5+4*5+5*5=(15+2+3+4+5)*5=145 points.
Also, for each finished horizontal line we get additional +2 (+10) points, and from each vertical +7 (+35) points. Thus, making it 190 already
Lastly, we have all five colours filled up +10 (+50).
Topping it with 240.

Ideally, no tiles are broken and we never pick 1st player token (no negative points), so absolute maximum is 240

Tema 156: Azul! - A Quick Tabletop_Squatch Review
Pregunta:
AZUL
Designer: Michael Kiesling
Publisher: Next Move Games
2-4 players
30-45 minutes

Azul is a tile laying game where players will take turns choosing matching tiles from a central stack of 5+ (depending on player count) that act as suppliers. You are trying to get pairs of 1-5 on your player board. At the end of a round you will move over one tile from each area on your board that is completely filled. The catch is each row can only have one color and if that tiles color is placed in your grid already you can’t place that same color there again. The game ends after the first player to complete a horizontal line in their grid and at that point the player with the most points will be the victor!

Azul will go down as a classic and every gamer should try it atleast once, especially at 2 players! The 2 player game is an exercise of strategy figuring out how to manipulate your opponent into giving you the turn you want. You will find yourself thinking 2-3 turns ahead however sometimes that may backfire and lose you that important match you needed.

The components in Azul are elegant and fit the theme so well. Each tile is heavy and beautifully colored. The player boards are thick and will withstand many plays. The draw string bag is a piece of art and will hold all your tiles in a safe place. The only fiddly part is the score marker and track. A dual layered board would be amazing for this as points can easily be messed up by a bump of the table

Fun thing about Azul is there are three different versions each playing slightly different. The original is my favorite!

Tema 159: Yet ANOTHER simple, solo variant
Pregunta:
Decided to create yet another solo variant!

I wanted a fairly simple setup, with some solid AI rules, but with some randomness thrown in.

1. Setup up as if for two players (one for yourself and one for AI) but don’t set out offer tiles just yet. Place your board in front of you, and the AI board above that. You can play as either side of the player board for yourself, but only use the standard side for the AI. Place factories in a vertical line on one side of the boards. Place the 1st player marker in the space between the two boards.



2. Place a scoring marker for the AI, according to your preferred level of difficulty: 50 for easy, 75 for intermediate and 100 for difficult.


3. Prior to setting up each factory offerings at the beginning of each round, draw one tile from the bag. This is the AI preference for this round. Place a marker (I have an extra one player token (not sure how or where I got it! Or you can use a scoring marker) and place it on the row corresponding to that tile on the first, leftmost column of the Wall of the AI board.




In subsequent rounds, if you draw the same tile as the previous round AI PREFERENCE, then simply draw again to get a different AI PREFERENCE row for the new round.

4. Return the drawn tile to the bag, shake to shuffle the tiles, then draw and place tile offerings as normal.



5. For the very first round, solo player starts as first player (this may change in future rounds), taking their preferred tiles, and placing remaining tiles in between the boards (“Center of Table”). Player and AI take alternating rounds as normal.

6. AI rules:
a. AI always grabs most number of tiles. If tiles are in Center of table, and AI is first to draw from it, then AI takes 1st player marker as normal.





b. If there is a tie in number of tiles, then check the AI PREFERENCE ROW on the AI Wall, prioritizing AI choice from left to right.

Example: there is a tie for most number of tiles in the factory between yellow (top), black (middle) and light blue (bottom). But since we determined at the beginning of the round that the AI PREFERENCE is the fourth row from the top, the AI PREFERENCE (going left to right) shows AI will prefer Orange first, then Black, then Light Blue etc. in this case, the AI eliminates the black (middle) and puts remaining tile(s) in Center of Table area.


c. If there is still a tie for number of tiles and AI preference, then priority goes from top to bottom of the factory tiles, with the Center of Table being last.

Example: there are three yellow tiles each in the second factory from the top, the third factory from top and the Center of Table. AI would then choose from the second from top factory, discarding those yellow tiles, and placing the remaining tile in center of table.




7. Score as normal. If AI has the first player marker in their floor, then deduct one point from their score and return first player marker to Center of table.

8. Play continues as normal until end of game condition (a completed horizontal row) is reached. End of game conditions is the same, and is scoring for endgame is as normal.

That’s it! If you beat the AI’s score, you win!

Let me know what you all think!

Respuesta 1:
If I'm not misunderstanding (and that's quite the possibility), I found it too easy to force the AI to take tiles she couldn't use. For example, let's take your bottom photo as a standalone situation. If I knew she had no place to put more than two yellow, I would take the blue tile from the bottom factory and put the remaining three yellow in the center. On her turn, she is forced to take all six yellow. Since she can only place two, the other four would go into the negative point slots as broken tiles. If I'm following the rules correctly, I'd have two suggestions. First, that she never pays for broken tiles; they are just discarded. Second, if she can't place more than half of the tiles she draws, she would go to the next preferred color.

Respuesta 2:
Sounds interesting. I'll try it out later today. but in the mean time, just to clarify, once you've figured out which tiles the AI would take, are those tiles placed on the AI's board or immediately put in the boxtop (like at the end of a round, after moving some tiles over and scoring)? I'm guessing it's the latter since: 1) the AI starts with a score (50, 75 or 100); 2) the AI preference token uses a space on the board; 3) in 6b example, you mention the AI "eliminates" the black and, in 6c example, "discarding those yellow". But @chilinski clearly think the AI's tiles go onto the board and add (or subtract) from AI's starting score. And in 7 and 8, you do say "score as normal" and "play continues as normal". So do you just mean the player plays and scores as normal while the AI just removes tiles from play but doesn't add them to the board?

Respuesta 3:
@kkstiles, interesting interpretation. I think you're right. I stumbled over what "eliminates" meant. For a fraction of a second when I read that, I thought perhaps the AI didn't play them to the wall but just tossed them, but I thought that could be just a wording thing. After reading your comments and thinking about it some more, it makes sense that the AI simply removes tiles from play. Otherwise, you'd have to provide some instruction for how to place the AI tiles on the wall, too. I'll have to try this again with the "remove from play/eliminate" method.

Respuesta 4:
Oh sorry @chilinski. I may not have been very clear. The AI doesn’t actually play the tiles it takes; the tiles are just discarded from play.

Respuesta 5:
Yes, @kkstiles, you got it right! That you for clarifying correctly! The AI merely discards the tiles it takes and doesn’t actually play them on their board!

Yes, it's this. I think it would be very common for someone to place something, score it, and then notice somewhere else on their board they have a vertical row that they completed 2 turns ago. "Wait, I don't think I scored that!" Those sorts of events become confusing since there is no way to mark what rows you have scored and which ones you haven't.

Some players would never make this mistake, but in a casual game among people who are socializing and keeping an eye on the kids and checking on the progress of dinner, it will happen a lot.

Pregunta:
I have had Azul: Summer Solstice for close to a yr and we love it. Saw the original Azul on sale and got it last week.

Every game WILL end in 5 rounds because the top row for all players (the one with the one tile placement) will complete in 5 rounds (unless we really have a bad probability day).
And all of us finish the row on the same turn (5th).
Then we count the pts.
Is this the only way that the game progresses every time?

Respuesta 1:
I've seen the game end in 5, 6, 7 rounds.

Just something to check.... You do realise that a ROUND doesn't end until all tiles on the table are drafted, right? You're going to have multiple turns in a round. And you don't move tiles across to your grid until the end of a ROUND.

Respuesta 2:
And even if a game does always end in 5 rounds when you play it, why would that be a problem? Many good games last a specific number of rounds.

Respuesta 3:
From the end of your post, I am not sure if you misunderstood one part of the rules (already mentioned by a previous response). You move tiles to the right, and score them, after all tiles on the table have been drafted. So 5 rounds will actually mean at least 20 turn (it is highly improbable or a player not to draft at least 4 times per round).
Having this, yes it is possible the game will only last for 5 rounds. It is part of your strategy to analyse if it is worth it to delay the game or the wrap it up because you are on the lead.

Respuesta 7:
other threads somewhat related by "top row" content (not necessarily obvious by title)

Respuesta 8:
Completed columns and tile sets are worth a lot more points than completed rows. If you have the opportunity to complete a column/set, at the expense of not completing a row in 5 turns, go for the column/set. Probably 2/3 of our games end in 5 rounds, and the other 1/3 go 6 rounds because the players prioritized a column. Maybe once in a very rare while, we have a 7-round game.

Respuesta 9:
Another possible error that would allow players to always fill the top row:

A player has to take all tiles of a certain color from a disc or the center when picking. They all need to go into the same row on the player board. Any surplus goes into the bottom row where they will count negative points at the round's end.

Hence, it is not a given that the top row will always be filled every round as there may not be a suitable single tile around anymore when picking.

I completely understand what you are talking about. A two player game is taking such a short amount of time, because that top row gets filled in quickly.

I always assume the game will end on round 5.

If I am losing, and I need to extend the game another round, I’ll try to prevent my opponent from finishing the top row, either. By taking the pieces he needs, or consolidating all of them in the center, so that he would take a huge penalty for completing the row. Or by taking other pieces he needs, such that when he does complete the top row, I will have caught p to him because he has too many incomplete attempted other rows.

Respuesta 15:
Rather than focusing on completing a horizontal row, focus on filling vertical columns, it will last a little longer and people will have higher scores. I have dropped tiles to the floor, that I could have used to complete a row, just to extend the game and try for more points.

Rather than focusing on completing a horizontal row, focus on filling vertical columns, it will last a little longer and people will have higher scores. I have dropped tiles to the floor, that I could have used to complete a row, just to extend the game and try for more points.
Completing the top three rows results in a very high score, especially with a column added in.

Also, the goal is to win, right? I’m never going to throw tiles on the floor instead of completing a row if I can end the game and win by completing the row.

Just something about the way they interchangeably used round and turn and being dissatisfied with games always ending at exactly the same time - just wanted to check they weren't making the surprisingly common rules mistake of thinking you move tiles across as soon as the line is completed.

Agreed that the 3rd to last sentence says “turn” when it should say “round.”

However.

Even if people do move tiles over as soon as the row is completed, would that matter? I mean, I always wait until the end of the round, but would it affect the scoring at all to do it the wrong way?

The only way I can see this (apparently common?) mistake making a difference is if someone were to move the tile over and then start a new color on that same row in the same round.

But obviously the OP isn’t doing that, otherwise he’d be asking why the game always ends on round 1 or 2.

The other possible problem, I suppose, would be if people mistakenly don’t finish the round? But the OP isn’t making that mistake, because he said “all players finish the top row in the same [round].”

So, if the game is going 5 rounds, but not shorter, and all players are finishing the top row, then I’m having a difficult time seeing what errors of any relevance the OP could be making? Unless I’m still missing something here?

Another possible error that would allow players to always fill the top row:

A player has to take all tiles of a certain color from a disc or the center when picking. They all need to go into the same row on the player board. Any surplus goes into the bottom row where they will count negative points at the round's end.

Hence, it is not a given that the top row will always be filled every round as there may not be a suitable single tile around anymore when picking.
I just re-read the thread and now I am really confused.

Why is there an assumption that people are playing wrong if the game always ends in 5 rounds? It is not difficult to complete the top row each round. It requires one tile. And considering that playing the 5th tile in the top row is usually worth 9 points and maybe 10 or more, I don’t understand why anyone would intentionally leave it unfilled.

In fact, in my experience, failing to tile the top row each round is generally a catastrophic error.

I would have to go back dozens and dozens of games to find one that went longer than 5 rounds, and of the very rare ones that did, at least a few, of them were done intentionally by a player who could have won by completing the top row but instead chose not to because he was going for a high score.

@potchie
I completely understand what you are talking about. A two player game is taking such a short amount of time, because that top row gets filled in quickly. We have actually tried to slow down the game, by not picking what we need, but inevitably someone is forced into it within that round or the next. We are following the rules correctly. I'm not sure if the same thing happens if played with more than two people.
With more players, though it might be slightly more difficult for any one player to tile the top row every time, I would think the overall probability of nobody tiling the top row after 5 rounds would decrease.

My point is that it seems to be a weirdly common mistake to make (look back through the rules forums) to move tiles across immediately.

And yes it actually does make a difference because you're supposed to move tiles across in a certain order and that DOES make a difference in the scoring.

Further to that, if you're then unclear about what constitutes a TURN vs a ROUND, you might be doing all sorts of things wrong. You might be starting to fill that row again within the same round. You might be resetting all factories after each player takes one turn.

I DON'T KNOW IF OP IS DOING THIS, HENCE WHY I ASKED.

I asked the question mainly because OP asked "is this normal"? People don't ask that question unless they feel something is wrong. Playing Azul for a full five rounds feels about right. But misunderstanding the rules and only taking five TURNS each would feel wrong. OP never came back to confirm which way they were playing. If they said "oh yeah we were definitely playing it correctly and taking multiple turns until the tiles are all drafted" when I would have said "ok cool, then yeah 5 rounds is about right".



Tema 164: Unofficial Solo Automa - Campaign Announcement
Pregunta:
When I created the the Azul unofficial Automa I had more envisioned than just one off games vs an automated opponent. I envisioned a campaign that took place over a single elimination tournament where players would take on automated opponents over the course of 5 games to prove who was the best. With new player murals the player must decide what to do with the tiles that fall to their factory floor. Do they use them to complete their own murals and regain some points or do they forgoe the points to unlock game breaking abilities that stay with them for the life of the tournament? They will have to weigh the risk of possibly losing the game to unlocking special abilities which will aid them as they advance through the progressively more difficult tournament. Each game will showcase variable setups and opponents that will require the player to adjust their game in order to advance.

In our experience, the first player to fill the top row does not always win. Also, as with drafting games, you can deny your opponent the tiles they need. I think you're viewing the strategy as much too simple. Azul is very popular for a reason.

Not sure if you are missing something but playing mostly 2p games, we’ve never noticed any correlation between filling in the top row first and winning. But also it’s probably not that common that both players wouldn’t complete the top row (or maybe the second row) in 5 rounds. It is hard to play a color on all five rows, esp in 2p where the tiles are not going to get “reshuffled” into the bag in only 5 rounds. There’s lots of points to be had in filling in your grid to maximize the points gotten from the row & column for each newly place tile. And then there’s being smart to stick your opponent with tiles they can’t place while avoiding that yourself.

Edit: Just to confirm, you’re not adding a tile to your grid as soon as a row is filled, are you? As in, if you’ve filled the left-hand row, you should only place and score one tile in each row on the right-hand side each round, which is comprised of all available tiles being drawn from the market. If you were placing tiles on the right as soon as a row filled (multiple times a round), then yes, the person doing it first would probably always win.

Respuesta 6:
I just played the normal level, and scored 61 points to Emma's 76. She completed 7 murals and completed no rows or columns in her masterpiece. I wonder if I played correctly if I kept her from scoring on her masterpiece.

What I like about this solo Automa is that it provides a decent replacement for the mental focus one puts toward paying attention to their opponents. I also like how I can avoid taking large piles of tiles because Emma does. But then she just happily places them in her masterpiece. This will get quite a few plays out of me.

Questions:
1. Does Emma lose 1 point for taking the first player tile? I assume so.

2. What's the point of playing tiles on the round counter, other than to track rounds? Why did you choose that instead of another black marker? Is Emma supposed to use that tile at some point?

Respuesta 7:
76 points is a lot of points from just murals. I would adjust your strategy so that she takes a few more tiles that are placed on her masterpiece.

1. She does.

2. The black marker could be knocked around and thus you’d lose track of what round it is. She doesn’t use that tile other than for round tracking.

Respuesta 8:
Hi, Mark!

First of all, congratulations for your work, this seems to be really well thought, and I am very eager to try! Your automa geeklist is also already favorited, I loved what you did with other games too.

That said, one thing that confuses me a little here: shouldn't this be titled a "solo variant" instead of a "solo automa"? I understand that the term "automa" (which IIRC was coined by the Automa Factory people for the Viticulture solo mode) refers to an "automaton" or an "artificial intelligence" based opponent. They make 1-player games viable by simulating the behavior of another player. And many times you can run more than one automa in the same game (like when using multiple automa decks in Scythe). So, from that standpoint, it seems that a "Solo Automa" is either redundant or could be better phrased as "Automa-based Solo Mode".

Also, the idea is usually to keep the regular game untouched (or minimally affected) by the use of the automa. But here you are adding a bunch of rules for Emma that alter significantly the decision set that the human user is going to play under, when compared to the multiplayer game (I might be wrong, as I haven't yet played against Emma). So, that's why I think this should be referred to as a "Solo Variant" (or maybe dukefanblue2005's Solo Variant or even "Emma Variant").

What do you think?



Tema 167: Opinions of two newbie-meeples
Pregunta:
Azul

Azul is a tile-drafting and pattern-building game with set collection bonuses. On each turn, players decorates their palace (player board) through azulejos (tiles) to get most of the points.

Fit to 2-player games: The game works well with two players, it is actually my favorite amount of players to have as the game gets really cut-throat

Time to play: Around 30 minutes

Set Up: Really quick. This kind of setup is my favourite: It takes no longer than a minute.

Interaction: The interaction is quite high and actually, quite aggressive. It might be that you take something needed from the opponent over what you need to let him pay the negative points.

Complexity: The game is very easy to learn through a clear rulebook and simple rules. It takes no more than 5 minutes to explain Azul to new people. Nevertheless, easy to learn does not mean easy to master as mistakes can have a very high price during the game. I had no significant mistakes in my first game.

Strategy/Luck: There is some luck component in the draw of the tiles but luck is not the only victory driver: Actually, the tactical component is quite strong.

Artwork: The components are good quality, particularly the tiles. My only criticism is that the different tiles and above all the score markers, can be easily moved with a clumsy move. The expansion tried to resolve this issue (see below for my view on the expansion) but a dual layer player board would have been appreciated. I would love the use of magnets but probably this would be a too pricey solution (an idea for a deluxe edition?).

Theme: Very abstract, although the tiles do a good job in reminding azulejos.

Replayability: Game is high replayable, every game will be different due to the tile draft. Furthermore, the two different sides of the player board offer even more variety to the game.

Overall: Azul's simplicity and at the same time Azul's depth, make Azul a game for everyone and a game that should be in any collection. What I really like about Azul is the high player interaction, which could be sometimes brutal and the importance of each choice in every round.

Would it be in my top five? I don’t see this game in my top 5 because I am not a big fun of abstracts. Nevertheless, I cannot recommend enough Azul as a great option for 2 players.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------

Quick opinions on the expansions

 

Overall: The expansion contains new double-sided player boards which are a good addition and increase the replayability and variety of the game. Furthermore, the expansion includes a plastic overlay that should help fix the artwork problem. Unfortunately, I got quite disappointed by its quality and to be sincere, it does not completely solve the problem. Furthermore, it is not aligned to the nice artwork of the game. Shame, because a better dual layer player board would have improved the quality of the game experience.

In summary: If you look for some new challenges because you play Azul a lot and you want to diversify your experience, this expansion is a buy (probably somewhat overpriced). If you look for improvements to the artwork, I think the expansion does not help too much and you might end up disappointed (it was the case for me).

Tema 170: Initial impression of Azul
Pregunta:
Azul probably needs no introduction. The game is stacked with accolades and has won numerous awards. What is more impressive to me is that it has won 2 awards: Spiel des Jahres and Deutscher Spiele Preis in 2018. These two awards are quite apart in terms of the crowds they cater to. Spiel des Jahres has inched more toward family gaming and the trend is that the Jury tends to select lighter and easier games. Meanwhile, Duetscher Spiele Preis, or the German Game Prize select games that agree with the lifestyle gamer which are generally more complex. For Azul to win both awards would indicate that the game is light enough to be embraced by the typical German family, yet having enough depth to attract the serious gamer. The most recent game to win both prizes occurred in 2009 when Dominion bagged both awards. Dominion is considered the granddaddy of all deck building games and is actually moderate in complexity. So that award was well-deserved for DSP but a more awkward selection for SdJ. Still, that was a decade ago and a case can be made that the SdJ is skewing more and more toward lighter family games which makes Azul’s win even more impressive. Having now played the game at least half a dozen times, I think both awards are justified and the game is outstanding for not only casual, family style gaming, but also for your heavy Euro gamers.

Azul is an abstract game that is all about drafting tiles and arranging them in specific patterns to score points. What’s unique about the game is how the tiles are drafted, organized and prioritized to maximize scoring. Not surprisingly, the rules are quite simple. On the middle of the table, are several discs known as the factory display and the number of discs in play depends on player count. Each round, 4 tiles are randomly drawn from a bag and placed on each factory display disc. These tiles are brightly colored acrylic tiles that come in five different colors and patterns. During a player’s turn, one can pick up a group of similar tiles from a single disc while pushing the leftover tiles to the center of the table. That means that for each disc, only one player can select from them because any remaining tiles will be pushed into a common pool. In subsequent turns when tiles are also in the common pool, player are free to pick up a group of similar tiles from the common pool. The important point of this tile drafting phase is that all tiles of a similar color or pattern must be selected. So if there are 5 blue tiles in the common pool and if you select blue tiles, you must pick up all 5.

The fun starts when you have to decide what to do with the tiles. Each player will have a personal board to put tiles. Tiles are place in 5 horizontal columns with increasing number of slots starting with 1 on top and 5 at the bottom. Each slot can only contain one tile and that means that row one can only have 1 tile and row 5 must contain 5. When a group of tiles are selected from the factory display or common pool, they must go into one row and one row only. Any excess tiles must be discarded to the factory floor where they will be penalized with negative points. So, if your row 5 already contains 4 blue tiles and you pick up 3 more blue tile, you can place only one tile in this row and the remaining 2 must be discarded to the factory floor. Of course, if your row 3 is empty, you could place all 3 blue tiles there to complete that row.

In this way, tile drafting and placement continues until all tiles are drafted from the factory floor. The round is then over. Players then check their tile placement and for every horizontal row that is completely filled, one representative tile of that type is moved over from the row to a 5×5 grid. The movement of the single tile from each completed row to the grid will score points based on adjacency to other tiles. Any negative points are also tallied during the end of each round. There is one restriction for placement of the representative tile in the 5×5 grid: no line or row can contain tiles of a similar color. So, this is very soduku-esq in that no row or column can have the same number. Your job is to place these tiles so that no two tiles of a similar type or color may touch each other.

The game continues until one person completely fills a horizontal line on the 5×5 grid which then ends the game immediately. In essence, this means Azul can last somewhere between 5-21 rounds, though it probably rarely exceeds 5-10 rounds per game. When the game is completed, players score bonus points for each completed line, column and for each complete set of 5 tiles of a similar type on the 5×5 grid. That’s it.

Like most abstracts, rules do a poor job of describing the actual experience of playing the game. In Azul, this is also true. The game is light and rules are simple, but there is tactical brilliance that is most evident in a 2 player game where each player has full control of their choice and how they can impact their opponent. Ideally, each tile selection must benefit not only your board, but if possible, must also impede your opponent’s choices. It is quite elegant at the two player level when you have this simple back and forth between players. It is immediately clear to me that some of this brilliance is muted or lost at higher player counts where there is less control on what tiles are available when your turns come around and also how many people will be impacted by your choice. Things are just much harder to control and I think you end up playing more to your own board rather than defensively to block others. With two players, it is easier to do both.

The simplest example of a defensive play in Azul is choice denial. You pick up a tile your opponent wants and deny them the opportunity to score points. This denial can be pretty devastating as a single move to deny someone can result in a huge loss in points, particularly end game point and so it is not to be ignored. You can also force your opponent to pick up groups of tiles that they can no longer place on their board. For example, if the horizontal line on the grid already has blue, your opponent cannot pick up blue for that row. If you force them to select blue and there is no legal placement on that horizontal line, then all the tiles are converted into negative points. You can position your selection such that your opponent is forced to pick up multiple tiles that they cannot place. It’s mean, it’s cruel, but it’s also very satisfying when you leave a 5 tile group for your opponent to place in their factory floor! Of course, everything comes at an opportunity cost. So, balance must be struck to ensure that your offensive and defensive plays maximizes your own score too.

Azul is great and Michael Kiesling is deserving of all the praise for his design. There are already 2 spin-offs for Azul that uses the same tile drafting system, but with different scoring methodologies. I have played Sintra, but still greatly prefer the plain vanilla Azul. There is something to be said about simplicity of the original design that already carries considerable depth. Additional complexity in my book is not always necessary. Still, I think the spin-offs are well regarded and I am happy that the entire Azul family is getting its due. This one stays in my collection right alongside Knizia’s Keltis series. Both games in the series have the same flavor, depth, pace and I hope, durability.

Initial impression: Great!

Tema 172: Oh dear - we've been playing this wrong for a year - please help me :)
Pregunta:
So we found out today that we have been playing this wrong for about a year

We were convinced that if you had an active row with a tile colour in it, you could not start another active row with the same kind of tile.

Then we got into another disagreement with someone who said that you could do the above - but only if you had already finished the other active line.

I don't think this is right either.

Can anyone give me a definitive ruling please.

An example - I have 3 out 5 blue tiles on the bottom / 5th row.
I pick up two blue tiles.
Can I just put those on the 3rd row (not the 5th) to start another row?
Could I then start a third row if I picked up more blue tiles?

It is quite amusing how apparently simple games can trip you up. Maybe it's a bit like mortgaging in Monopoly

Thanks in advance for any help.

Respuesta 1:
There is no restriction on the colour you can put into a new line, and you can choose to start another line of the same colour even while the other is unfinished.

This seems to be the most common mistake made in Azul!

Respuesta 2:
You can have multiple incomplete lines of the same color.

Respuesta 3:
Yes, you can start that 3rd row with blue without having to complete your 5th row in blue.

The only rule is that you cannot split the tiles that you pick up for the purpose of distributing them to these two rows. Whatever you pick up must go to only of one the rows.

If it were illegal to have two rows with the same color, the rules would surely say so.

But instead the rules simply say "Then, add the tiles you picked to one of the 5 pattern lines on your player board (the first line has 1 space to hold 1 tile, the fifth line has 5)." and that a given line cannot have different colors.

They do not state that you must add the tiles to an existing line of the color if you have such a line.

And if it were illegal to have two rows with the same color, it would be rather surprising that the rules show examples of player boards with two lines of the same color!

I think we misread this line in the rulebook:
"Once all spaces of a pattern line are filled, that line is considered complete. If you have picked up more tiles than you can place in your chosen pattern line, you must place the excess tiles in the floor line (see Floor line)."

We assumed "chosen pattern line" had to be a single row per tile type - i.e. if you had 1 space for a blue tile left on row 3 and picked up 4 tiles, you had to place 1 and put 3 on the floor. As opposed to being able to place them on a new row 4 or 5 if you had space.

Tema 173: First player advantage
Pregunta:
How big is the first player advantage in a 2 player game? If there's a serious advantage, can it be mitigated in any way?

Respuesta 1:
There is not a serious advantage.

Respuesta 2:
in my opinion it is not significant

Respuesta 3:
It depends. Sometimes having the first place can be advantageous, for example when you want to be sure you have the tiles you need, or when you want to counter another player by being sure to take the tiles they need. Otherwise I see no advantage knowing that it still brings you a penalty.

agreed, my understanding of the question is that the OP wants to know if the first player of a game has an advantage. Sure, later in the game it can make a difference but it costs you one point less (at least)

Respuesta 5:
I agree with the other responses that it doesn't seem to give much of an advantage. If you're looking for a way to mitigate it, you can always auction off the right to go first: "I'll give you a one-point lead if I can go first," "No, I'll give you a two-point lead if *I* can go first," etc. until someone takes the deal.

Respuesta 6:
Also depends on the skill of your opponent.

BGA doesn't allow access to their data for analyses like these beyond what you see in the statistics and I believe scraping is against their guidelines.
Winner's average for going first in rounds is 2.81 vs overall of 2.46. Top ranked players tend to lie even closer to 3. This indicates that picking first turn, despite the -1 tile, is highly valued and leads to winning more.
There is simply no reason to believe starting player in the first round is not significant while top players highly value it for the other rounds.

But sure, put the burden of proof on those saying there is a big disparity. It's easy to casually dismiss it as insignificant.
In general starting player advantage is a thing in many games, but the majority of players who play casually won't really notice it as this effect falls away when players are less competitive.

Then again the fix is easy, just auction starting player or use the pie rule in 2p. Especially after setup is revealed as in Azul it's quite dependent on the starting setup i'd feel. Sometimes you just have setups where first player picks the perfect 3 or 4 to start the middle column AND get's to keep starting player for the next round easily.

Quote:

That’s basically what I meant when I said it wasn’t serious.

Respuesta 11:
After playing circa 150 games of Azul at 2 player, I would say the benefit of going first applies pretty much only applies in the first and fifth rounds, in the central rounds it negligible.

In terms of a points deficit, since going first in round one is "free", the only points-affecting factor is the -1 going into round 5, which in a two player game is the final round before a bag refill is required, and in the vast majority of games doesn't happen.

Where the advantage/disadvantage really applies, is in the first round it allows you get a triple blue if one is available, starting dead center of the mosaic, which is generally speaking the best possible position to start.

In the final round, is if you are aware that you require the vast majority if not all of all of the remaining tiles of one colour going into round 5, which can be worth 10, 7 or 17 points in final scoring, not to mention 1-8 points in end of round scoring for round 5.

In terms of a mitigation, you would remove the points deficit for going first, and ensure that the player who goes first in round one, goes second in round five I guess, but we have never tried that as we enjoy the strategy of the rules-as-written around the first player token.

This is obviously from the perspective of someone who has played a lot, to the casual player they won't notice so much, but the fact remains that going first towards the end of the game provides a significant advantage.

Warm regards,
Andy



Tema 174: First time review
Pregunta:
Intro

After using BGG as a reference for many years, this is my first time writing a review.

I picked Azul to play with my family; they mostly prefer lighter games, and after reading reviews about Azul, it sounded like something we would all like. After learning the rules and practicing through it together, we played several rounds with four players.

Design

I really liked the look and feel of this game. The design is simple enough, but there is something rewarding about arranging the ceramic tiles on the player board. I liked the quality of the tiles and think they help make the game really aesthetically pleasing.

Gameplay

The rules are straightforward and easy to understand. Essentially, gameplay revolves around taking tiles from community spaces and arranging them on your individual player board to score points.

One of the things I like about Azul -- and games like it -- is that while the rules are simple, there is still a noticeable amount of choice within the game. It is not a very deep game, but players do need to give some thought to how they are selecting and placing their tiles.

It strikes a good balance of requiring strategy to score points, but not being so complex that a stronger player will run away with the game, or a weaker player won't be able to keep up at all. We liked this about the game, although I could see how other gamers might be looking for something a bit more involved.

There is little randomness or luck involved other than the initial placement of the tiles on the community markets, and even those are spaces all players can take tiles from. As the game unfolds, players will be impacted more by the randomness of available tiles compared to what they need, but this is also impacted on the approach players have taken to try to score the most points.

Social

It's not a "party game," but we did like that once we all understood the rules, the mechanics were simple enough that we could talk and drink beer while the game still moved pretty quickly.

One thing that players might not like -- although we were fine with -- is that there is little actual player to player interaction in the game. Occasionally we would try to avoid giving a player a bunch of tiles they needed or a player would get stuck with a handful they don't need, but mostly we just took turns taking tiles and placing them on our boards. In 2 or 3 player games there might be more strategy involved in this.

Summary

We played this game very recreationally, and it was exactly what we were looking for. I have no doubt it will be a regular member of the rotation going forward.



Tema 175: Neoprene Factory Mat
Pregunta:
Has anyone designed a neoprene mat that has all of the factory tiles, maybe color coded for different player counts? All I ever see is the 2-player mat.



Tema 176: Azul Solo Variant
Pregunta:
Hi guys, Azul is such a famous game I'm surprised there's not a lot of solo variant for it. In the file section, there's only one solo variant and I can only see a few in the forum. So I decided to create my own. Now there are a couple of things that I want to establish with this solo variant.

- No cards or additional stuff is needed to play the solo variant
- No high score, you beat the AI or you lose
- Simple yet powerful AI decision
- You can "affect" the AI decision so there's a way to win if you use the right strategy.
- Multiple difficulties

Ok, so here's the solo mode, let me know what you guys think about it. If I have good feedback I will post it on the file section too.

Golden Rule of solo mode:
- AI plays with the advanced side (colorless board)
- You play normally with the normal side except that you are always the first player no matter what.

I. Factory Offer
- AI use the same rule when picking and placing tiles, meaning they either pick from the center or from one of the display. And they can’t place a tile on a pattern line that already has a different tile placed on it. Also, all tiles that can’t be placed are dropped to the Floor line as usual.
- This is how the AI chooses the tile to pick:
- AI get the most amount of tiles that it can place legally. If there’s no tile that it can place legally, take the most tiles and put them on the Floor line
- If there’s a tie, get the tile that can complete a pattern line instead of starting a new one
- If there’s still a tie between tiles that can complete a pattern line you decide which tiles to get, unless if the tied tiles is between tiles on the Center vs tiles on the factory display then you always prioritize tiles on the Center.
- The same thing happens if there’s a tie between tiles that started a new pattern line; you decide which tiles to get and. unless if the tied tiles is between tiles on the Center vs tiles on the factory display then you always prioritize tiles on Center. You place this tile at the top most available pattern line. Remember the normal rule of tiles that drop to the floor line
- The most important thing is to remember that you need to place the tile legally. So if there's already a black tile on the wall on row 1, you can't place a black tile on the pattern line on row 1 .

II. Wall-tiling
Wall tiling work the same way as normal for you. For the AI, it still can't have a tile of the same color in a row but it can have a tile of the same color in a column. This is the rule of where to place the tiles for AI:
- AI placed a tile from a complete pattern line to the right most available space of the corresponding wall

Scoring
Scoring for you and AI is the same, the only difference here is that the value on the Floor line of the AI will change based on the difficulty you choose. Here’s the value

Easy: All factory tiles is valued at -1
Normal: All factory tiles is valued at 0
Hard: Factory tile has this value 0, 1, 1, 1, 2, 2, 2
Very Hard: Factory tile has this value 1, 1, 2, 2, 2, 3, 3
Impossible: Factory tile has this value 3, 3, 2, 2, 2, 1, 1

Note from hard and above, the Floor line value is actually positive and not negative. This means that if the AI drop a tile it can still count as a point. This is done to counter balance the fact that you can “affect” what the AI will choose based on what you do.

III. Preparing The Next Round & End Of The Game
This work the same as normal, but remember you will always be the first player. Final score bonus is still the same for both you and AI

I hope I completely misunderstood this, otherwise that makes the decision tree absolutely broken.

I just won in impossible mode :
75 + bonus 6+14+10 = 105 vs 28 + bonus 0 + floor 16 = 44.

Some thoughts :
- Going first every round without paying the cost is a HUUUUUGE advantage, I was able to grab a group of 3 tiles almost every turn.
- if I can choose where to put AI's tiles freely, then I always choose the row on the bottom, which is much harder to fill. AI score 0 on the first round.
- If AI goes for tiles that allow for row completion, then it almost always drops some of these tiles on the floor where they score only up to 3 points each,
- If several groups are still tied, then it's very easy for me to choose the one I am the least interested of. I managed to complete a colour by round 4 which probably never happened in any of my solo or multiplayer games.
- And then I just ended the game after round 5 (assuming the standard end game trigger applies here) finishing two columns and three rows in the process.

Am I completely missing a rule here ?

I think you might have missed something, there's no way that the ai score 0 on the first round and on impossible if you complete the game the air should have 70+ point that's without the bonus. Here's something that you might have missed

- yes going first is an advantage, but you need to make the ai take the first point marker if you do not want to get the penalty. And getting a first point marker can mean 1-3 points for the ai depending on the tile on the floor line

- you can always place tile on the bottom of the row for the air, but remember if there's a tie on the largest group of tile, ai always choose the tile that will complete a row

- AI dropping tiles on the floor is not a good thing for you. If it drop a tile it means that It completed a row and get point it, it drop some tile and get point for it and you also missed a chance to grab a lot of tiles since the ai just grabbed it.

- remember that if it's a tie for the largest group of tile you must first choose the one that will complete a row first. Then you can choose freely as long as what you are choosing is not an illegal move.

- remember that the ai plays with the colorless board and that the floor line is reset after every round

- if after doing all this you still think the air s too easy. Try playing with impossible but always try to put the tile at the top lost row whenever you can. Keep in mind completing a row that is already started always take priority.

Respuesta 3:
Just an example to what I did to make AI score 0 points on round 1.
- On my first turn, I grab 3 tiles.
- Then, on AI's turn, only groups of 2 tiles remain. I count the amount of each color and select red because there are only 4 tiles of that color (2 groups of 2). I choose to put them on the last row, perfectly knowing AI won't be able to finish that on that turn, but that is still a legal move.
- I take a group of two yellow tiles so that I can build in the center of the table a group of two blue tiles.
- On AI's next turn, it automatically takes the 2 red (there are no groups of 3 tiles and it needs to complete that row, or at least, get closer to it). While doing that, AI gently sends the remaining blue tiles I needed in the center to build a group of 4 tiles that I grab next turn !

Rinse and repeat for almost the entire first round : it had all rows 2-5 with a single empty space and no tile on the floor, meaning 0 points.

Ah you are specifically choosing the tile so that the AI is short of one tile instead of trying to built your own board. Yes in that case it's possible to get the AI to get 0 points on round 1, but unless it's a super coincidence you wouldn't get a board with tile that is clump together and generate maximum point. Remember that you play with the NORMAL side and AI play with the ADVANCED side.

I tried 5 games just now by specifically trying to make the AI not get any point instead of focusing on my own board, yes the AI get 0 point at the first round but I also only get around 3-4 point and because the AI is almost done on all 4 rows and dropped tile on the floor are positive point for it, in round 2 the AI always get 15 point minimum most of the time it gets around 17-20. In the mean time at round 2 I usually only get around 8-12. By the end of round 4 the AI is so far ahead that even with the 10 point bonus from 2 colors (a total of 20) I can't catch up. At round 5 I can either finish the game and most of the time will lose or has a very small lead. If I extend to round 6 it get worst again because with this negative strategy every even round the AI will get massive point. This is the score that I get from 5 games against impossible AI, first score is me

- 80 vs 85
- 101 vs 97
- 96 vs 99
- 110 vs 117
- 90 vs 94

Let me know once you try a few games. If you still think the AI is super easy try it with this one change. If the biggest group of tile can't complete a row the AI will always try to start a new row at the top most available row. This will make sure the AI always generate point but it will be smaller than the other strategy.

Respuesta 5:
Edited the rules a bit, thx for @magicteddy for the feedback.

- The AI now place the tile that they get either to complete a pattern line or place it at the top most available pattern line.
- Edited the floor line value a bit so it's harder

Based on my plays, the floor line is a mechanic to hold back the player that is getting the most tile all the time. That's why if this floor line value is 0 or positive, the player that keep on getting the most tile will have a high point. So the AI is designed with these things in mind

- He will always try to get the most tile even if it means dropping tile to the floor
- Dropping tile to the floor is actually a good think for the AI in higher difficulty
- Since the AI is playing with the advanced board he will most of the time get full point from the column (15 points + 7 bonus point)
- Game will most probably last 5 or 6 round since the AI is always trying to complete the top most pattern line. You might be able to stop it get the top row on round 5, but in round 6 100% it will always suceed in completing a line and ending the game.

Respuesta 6:
I tried once more with the former rules and won 74-54. As in my first attempt AI score 0 on the first round. I score a little less as I filled columns #3 and #5 which is less efficient than #3 and #4.

I tried again with the updated rules and won 103-58.
There was only one round where AI scored 8 points on the floor, otherwise usually 2 or 4. It managed to score the first line.
AI started the last round with a single tile on both rows 4 and 5. I took just enough of these colours from the market to make sure AI will not be able to fill those rows, while still attempting to take these colors each turn according to it's priority list. That's a total of 7 tiles worth nothing.

I discovered I can limit AI's scoring this way : let's suppose AI fills row #5 with blue tiles. If I don't want this color to go on the last column (where it would score 5 and complete a column or example), it's very easy to grab two blue tiles and fill row #2 with them. When scoring, that prevents the blue tile from row 5 to go on column 5, because that colour would already be there. So instead it goes in column #4 where it scores 1 pt.

I might again have missed a rule but being able to choose the colour AI takes is overpowered in my humble opinion.

I have a simillar thing going on on my last game but the AI still won 66-65, here's a picture of it

That should not be possible, why? because you fill row#2 first before you fill row#5. It's possible if you fill out row #2 first with blue, but then you will have to put a tile (or more) of any color on row #3 and #4 first then you can fill roll #5 with blue.

But what you said does give me an idea though. What if we add this one new rule for the AI:

- AI can't have the same color in a row just as normal but it can have the same color in a column.

This will make sure that the AI can get a minimum of 2 column on each game. I'm gonna start scoring my game using this new rule and I'll separate the base + bonus with the floor line scoring. This way we will know on which difficulty I win and we can adjust accordingly.

Respuesta 8:
Ok, managed to play 9 round this weekend and this is the result. The first score is always my score, second score is AI. The number below the score is what the ai score in the floor line. So at game 1 round 1 the AI dropped 3 tiles to the floor. I note the score like that so we can see on which difficulty I won and on which difficulty I lost
I think I'm confortable with the difficulty and AI behavior now. Out of 9 games I only won once against the Impossible AI and I won by a very small margin. I'm making the hard AI a bit more difficult so the jump is not that high from one AI level to the other. Next I'm planning to make a PDF version along with some example so it's clear on what the AI must do on it's turn.

Tema 177: Azul or Sagrada
Pregunta:
Hello!
Looking to get a game that i can play 2P with my 6 year old son and with my wife occasionaly 3P and 2P.

I'm undecided between azul and sagrada.

My son loves kingdomino, also sleeping queens, rhino hero and takenoko (we play a simplified version). For Sagrada i would have to play without the tool cards, and Azul maybe remove negative points.

My wife loves 2 player bohnanza and dominion. She is very competitive and gets quite angry with take that moves, so maybe azul won't work for us, unless maybe we don't look at each others boards, which im not sure would ruin the game.

Any help would be much appreciated!
Jorge

Respuesta 1:
Based on your descriptions, would suggest going with Sagrada. A huge part of Azul is looking at each other’s boards for the optimal move. Without that, Azul would become boring.

Respuesta 2:
Hi Jorge.
I would suggest going with Sagrada. Azul has too much planning ahead and you can really screw someone else, even unintentional.
Sagrada seems like a more family friendly option. And no need to remove the tools since you can use it or not, and they count as points at the end of the game.

Respuesta 3:
On a personal note, I prefer multiple time Azul over Sagrada (I don't dislike the second one, I just like the first one much more).

Going through your description, I have to agree with Mike and Mauricio. Sagrada is a simpler game and a less take that one.(specially at 2p).

Although the not looking at the other player board system could ease on the take that for Azul, ultimately it doesn't take it away. A lot of times, the optimal move for you is a screw over for the other one, and it can get frustrating sometimes ^^'

Respuesta 4:
Personally I'd side with Azul over Sagrada, the take that element usually doesn't start coming into play until you start gaining more experience with the game, you need to learn to take care of your own scoring strategy before you can start worrying about what other people are doing and once you get to that level you won't really notice so much that you are starting to look at what others are doing as the progression feels fairly natural. As for Sagrada my biggest complaint about that game is that I just find it dull.

Respuesta 5:
Azul is great, but very spiteful. My non-gaming spouse loves Azul despite the hate draft. Sagrada is much easier going than this, but it may be more complicated for a 6 y/o child.

Respuesta 6:
I completely agree with your take on what makes Azul so good as a game. With a six-year old, however, I think it is just fine in teaching other concepts like prioritizing what groups of tiles you could pick to best fill out your board. "Oooh, there's a group a 3 yellows, and two other groups of 2 yellows. I'm sure to be able to get 5 this round." That's a decent skill to begin working on for young kids.

Your responsiveness on these forums is always impressive Michael, but actively briefing against your own game to save the feelings of a six year old child is a touch of class, well played mate

Respuesta 8:
Between the two, definitely Azul (though realistically, for a 6 year old I would try to find maybe something else).
Azul's decisions are improved by thinking deeply about each move, but you can make those same decisions even if you don't plan everything out.
Sagrada requires planning ahead to even make reasonable decisions that won't trap you in a corner (not a fun time).



Tema 178: Playing something summer pavilion-like with base azul?
Pregunta:
Hello! I own base Azul and cannot bring myself to go for summer pavilion as well, but I was wondering about ways to add more variability to base Azul, so I had this thought:

Can we simply make printouts of new boards that are arranged like summer pavilion but designed to work with fives instead of sixes in mind? For example, 5 concentric circles made up of five tiles each, and a center five tile, with bonuses arranged in somehow. There would be one extra central board with the 5 wild colors per round (with 5 rounds instead of 6), as well as additional center drafts.

Can anyone think of any immediate problems with this? Maybe I will doodle some designs to see if there is something I am missing. The only potential problem that jumps out at me right now could be if base Azul does not have enough pieces for the mechanism somehow, but since base Azul has a potentially large left over staging area per player whereas summer pavilion only kept 4, it seems that should not be an issue. And the tiles are obviously square, so would not be able to touch except at the edges.

I think the direction that seems very trivial to do would be to play base Azul with Summer Pavilion, but I am trying to instill more life into what I already have, not that I have any problems with base Azul and still enjoy it a lot.

Respuesta 1:
So, after playing around a bit with sketchometry, this was what I came up with. The main problem is that obviously the math doesn't work out well for the connections between outer pentagons. However, it could make sort of a little tree like structure, which is kind of cool. So, it seems like it could work, there would be five pillars (between 2/3 outer and whatever it is inner), five statues (between 1/2 of one outer and 3/4 of a different outer, which is the same as summer pavilion), and five windows (between 4/5).

I think it could be done! I'm not sure if I'm going to devote any energy to actually making it happen since I'm terrible with computer art and having to work with pentagons seems like a huge pain. But, if I ever do and it works I'll post it back here, or if it seems like an interesting project for anyone else! It really seems quite doable, and should play almost exactly like summer pavilion.

Edit: Now that I think about it, adding a line in the middle of the "tree" creates a new little cubby (2 of outer, 3 of another outer, and whatever inner) that could be used for a new weak power, since it is three sided and 2/3 are already overloaded with both a pillar and a statue, but could have interesting tactical implications as well?

Tema 179: A College Student's Review of Azul
Pregunta:
***This BGG forum post was composed as a course requirement for an honors seminar at Central
College (Board in Class: An Academic Survey of Modern Board Games, SP21). Constructive
feedback and conversation from all BGG users is welcomed and encouraged!***

I am currently taking a college course that centers around playing board games. The class started in mid-January, about three months ago, and out of all of the games we have played in that time, I have only won a game twice. Azul was one of those games.

At first, as my professor was explaining the rules of the game, I didn't see how Azul would be any easier for me to win than any of the other games we had played. I was interested in it and it seemed like it would be really fun to play, but I had no hopes of winning the game.

As we got into the game, though, I began to figure out my strategy, and I did this much more quickly than I usually do. Since you gain more points in Azul by connecting your placed tiles, I quickly discovered that this was very easy to do by working out from the upper left corner. With my first turn in every round, I was always looking to add a tile to my first horizontal row, and from there, I was hoping to get lucky enough to get the right number of tiles of the right pattern so that I could expand my placed tiles from the upper left corner. Because I was successful in this game and I understood it well, I really enjoyed playing this game, and I would love to play it again sometime, given the chance.

One aspect of this game that I liked was the rule concerning broken tiles. To place a tile in any row, you must first meet its "requirement" and complete the corresponding row to the left of the board with the proper number of matching tiles. You must have at least that number of tiles to place it, and although you can use more tiles than required, any additional tiles will be considered a broken tile and you will lose a point for every broken tile. I liked this rule because it made it more challenging to place the certain tile that you were looking to place- ideally, you wanted to wait for that exact number of matching tiles to become available for you to pick up on your first turn, before they are dumped into the middle. Obviously, this didn't always happen. For me, however, when I played this game, it seemed to happen a lot, and I think this might be part of the reason why I had an easy time winning. I guess, in that respect, there is a little bit of luck involved.

Another thing worth mentioning about this game is its artwork. I personally am not as into these kinds of board games as some people are and I don't know much about board game artwork, but I thought this game displayed really nice artwork. The tile pieces were very pretty, and so was the board. A wide variety of colors and patterns were utilized, perhaps obviously, which made the game visually appealing.

One idea I had about how the game could be changed is if players were given the option to use another player's broken tile/s if they needed it and wished to do so. Players would have to consider whether they wanted to take the tile, which they could really use, even though that would place their opponent at a slight advantage because they would no longer lose a point because of their broken tile. I think this might make it a little easier to get the right number of tiles that one needs at that specific time and would also offer a way for players to get rid of their broken tiles. However, I have not given much thought to how this change in the rules would affect the game overall- it's just an idea.

In my opinion, Azul is a great game because it is very light and relaxed, but still presents a challenge and makes you think. While playing this game, you have to consider what tiles you most need to place and what tiles- paying close attention to the type and number of tiles- are available for you to use. Players can even play slightly competitively if they wish by strategically taking tiles that they notice another player is desperately trying to get a hold of- I did this without realizing it to my professor! Azul is an all-around great game, and what I appreciate most about it is that it is complex enough that it offers a challenge but easy enough that I can understand and be successful in it. This game might be a good game to play for those like me who have a hard time fully understanding some of those heavier games.

Good write-up. If you have the need, or opportunity to expand on it as part of your coursework you might wish to address how the game changes at different player counts. At 2P for example, to improve your chances of winning you have to pay attention to your opponents board and often it can be very cut-throat - deliberately forcing your opponent to take multiple negative points rather than gaining fewer for yourself, it is far from relaxed then. (This also helps at 3P and 4P but you are less able to do it watching 2 or 3 other boards).

Tema 184: Análisis Azul por Fer Meneses
Pregunta:
Construir los coloridos tableros de Azul es muy entretenido, bello y sencillo de aprender. La calidad de los componentes es muy buena, y manipular los pequeños cerámicos da mucho gusto. A pesar de todas sus buenas cualidades, no es un juego que destaque ni que despierte mucha pasión. Creo que es una buena opción para pasar un buen rato de manera distendida pues las partidas son muy fluidas y no requieren un gran esfuerzo en cuanto a la planeación y la estrategia. Además, Azul se adapta perfectamente a jugadores con poca experiencia en los juegos de mesa.

Dos de las mejores cualidades de Azul son su belleza y su facilidad de juego, combinación muy fuerte para atraer a nuevos jugadores. Los cerámicos que hay que acomodar en los tableros son espectaculares, y las paredes que cada uno va construyendo, muy llamativas. Las reglas son sencillas y las formas de obtener puntos son claras. No es tan fácil sumar las filas y columnas y muchas personas tardan en aprender cómo realizar correctamente el conteo, pero todos entienden cómo se debe llenar el tablero y después de dos o tres rondas se aprende a puntuar. El juego es muy fluido y se deben tomar importantes decisiones pues hay momentos críticos para recoger losetas y nadie quiere quedarse con algún sobrante difícil de colocar.

¿Qué estrategia seguir? No me queda muy claro cuánta libertad hay para elegir un camino, pues la disposición de los mosaicos y las acciones de los demás jugadores muchas veces conducen a opciones que van cambiando el plan inicial. Sin duda se puede desarrollar una técnica para tomar las fichas correctas en el momento apropiado, incluso para bloquear a los demás jugadores, pero a veces resulta inevitable tener que recoger mosaicos no deseados o no ser capaces de completar la fila prevista. Posiblemente hayan estrategias complejas para seguir, que puedan mitigar el azar en gran medida, pero no es algo que el juego sugiera ni que sea fácil descubrir. La sensación que me queda después de haber jugado numerosas partidas es que se vive ronda por ronda y los planes deben sea maleables, pues uno puede tener alguna estrategia a largo plazo, como completar objetivos de color, pero no hay guías claras y a veces las opciones son limitadas.

En cuanto al ritmo del juego, una partida promedio puede durar unos 40 minutos y transcurrir con mucha fluidez, pues no es común encontrarse en situaciones de análisis parálisis. Sin embargo, algo que encuentro negativo es la monotonía de las rondas: el juego es siempre igual, no hay etapas marcadas. Si bien la dinámica no aburre, no hay momentos emocionantes ni situaciones críticas. Esta es la razón por la cual Azul no es, a mi criterio, un juego que destaque y que uno elija con ansiedad en una ludoteca. Simplemente le falta ese ingrediente de pasión, de estar expectante por saber si en el siguiente movimiento podrás concretar el plan que hará que despegues en el puntaje y consigas una ventaja importante, o el temor a llegar a una situación con graves perjuicios para la estrategia elegida. En Azul los mosaicos se suceden unos a otros, otorgando más o menos puntos, realizando una jugada eficiente o encontrándote forzado a llevarte azulejos que no tienen lugar en la pared, pero sin grandes emociones.

En conclusión, Azul es muy agradable debido principalmente a su estética y su facilidad de juego. Si bien hay mucha fluidez en una partida, no hay etapas marcadas a lo largo del juego y esto genera una cierta monotonía, que no aburre pero tampoco emociona. Aunque pienso que Azul no es un juego que destaque, armar estos tableros de mosaicos es una excelente oportunidad para introducir a jugadores inexpertos en el mundo lúdico y también pasar un buen rato sin tener que esforzarse mucho planeando estrategias complicadas.

Tema 186: Why this game still hits the table after 350 plays
Pregunta:
Last night I played #349 and #350 of this game. It will very shortly be take over #1 spot in my games played list (since I started logging games in 2012).

After so many plays, each game seems so different. In the first game, the distribution of the tiles was very odd and neither myself nor my good friend could get anywhere. The final score, after five rounds, was 38-26. The lowest score we have ever seen.

The second game went six rounds. I ended up with three verticals, a horizontal and all of the reds. My friend had two verticals, a horizontal, and all of the light blue. But I took a lot of penalty points executing that third vertical, and only narrowly won 87-83.

This is the same game? Azul? Both times?

After 350 games, I have no "set strategy" I can fall back on. No style of play which is guaranteed to lead to victory. It never gets stale.

Respuesta 1:
Azul is my most in-person played game as well... a mere 90. Will definitely hit a century this year. (Wingspan is my second most played game at 46.) Amazing that you have 350 plays! Definitely getting your money’s worth.

The 2-player game is very much a "take that" sort of game of immediate strategic taking and blocking.

The 3 and 4 player games are a little more open-ended as it really is hard to keep track of what two or three other players are looking for at the same time. 4-player games can be especially wild affairs.

But I find it enjoyable at all player counts.

Tema 187: Jelby Plays Games - Azul
Pregunta:
Azul is designed by Michael Kiesling and published by Next Move Games. It’s a light weight game that 2-4 players can play in about 30-45 minutes.

Azul is such a great game to introduce to anyone. It is probably one of the best “gateway” games to get new board gamers into the board gaming hobby. It’s quick, easy, and fun!

Each round is set up by placing 4 tiles on each factory. Players draft tiles from the factories by taking all of one color from one factory and pushing the rest into the middle. You place those tiles onto your player board in one row on the left side. Any extras that don’t fit in that row are broken tiles and are placed at the bottom of your board. You can take tiles from the middle pile, but if you’re the first to do so, you take the “1st” tile also, which goes to the bottom of your player board, but lets you draft first next round. This continues until all the tiles are taken.

Then each player places one tile from each completely filled row on the left side and move it to the matching space on the right side of their board. You score 1 point for each tile in an connecting line both horizontally and vertically from that tile. Then you lose points for any broken tiles at the bottom.

Once a player has completely filled all 5 spaces of one row on the right side of their board, the game ends. Players score bonus points for completing a whole row or column, or all 5 tiles of the same type. Whoever has the most points wins!

This is definitely an abstract game, but it is beautifully designed. The tiles are so aesthetically pleasing that you just love collecting and placing them in their little square spots. They also make a wonderful clacking noise in the bag. The gameplay is seamless. The drafting mechanic is perfect, and it really drives this game and makes it great.

We personally like Azul: Summer Pavilion slightly more, but for people who don’t game as much, this is the perfect combination of simplicity and strategy. There hasn’t been anyone that we’ve played this game with that didn’t enjoy it. Honestly, everyone should own a copy of Azul.

Azul the new Essen 2017 release from Plan B Games. While many at GenCon were excited to see the Golem themed version of Century; Azul was the only game that I had eyes for at the show. I’ve had my copy for just over a week now, and it’s been in constant play. In this game, players try to decorate the palace of King Manuel I of Portugal in a style mimicking that of the Alhambra palace in Spain.





The tiles in the game are nice plastic tiles. There are five different designs with 20 copies of each. These tiles are mixed up in the provided bag at the start of the game. Each player gets his own player board which has his personal score track as well as an area to work on his wall designs. There are a number of Factory displays that are placed in a circle on the table (the actual number based on the number of players). A start player is chosen at random, and that player then dips his hand into the bad and randomly draws out 4 tiles for each Factory display on the table.



The game will be played over a number of rounds – each following the same three phases: A) Factory Offer, B) Wall-tiling, C) Setup.

In the Factory Offer phase, players take turns choosing tiles from the board – with the goal being to try to fill in all the lines on the left side of their player board. This phase will continue until all tiles have been chosen. The starting player starts, and places the start player marker into the center of the table. In general, players have two choices. They can choose to take all the tiles of the same color from any one of the Factory displays. All unchosen tiles are then moved into the center of the table. The player can also choose to take tiles from the center of the table – taking all the tiles there of the same color. If he is the first player to do this in a round, he also takes the starting player tile.



The chosen tiles must now immediately be played on the player board – into the triangle of empty squares on the left of the board OR into the floor row at the very bottom of the player board. If the start player marker token is chosen, it must go into the floor row. The colored tiles must be placed into a SINGLE row; they must be placed from right to left in the chosen line. Once a line has tiles in it, only matching tiles can be placed in that line. Furthermore, if you have already placed tiles into your colored wall on the right, you cannot place tiles in the line IF you already have a matching tile in the colored wall in that same row. If you have more tiles than you can place in empty spaces in that row, you must put the extras into the floor row. In the unlikely event that your floor line is already full, simply discard any tiles that cannot fit in your floor line. Note that you could also choose to put your selected tiles into the floor line.

In the wall-tiling phase, players now move over tiles from completed planning lines onto their colored wall. Starting at the top of your plan (i.e. the row with only one space in it), if every space in that row is filled, move the rightmost tile into the matching space on the wall row to the right. Then, score the tile you just placed. If there are no other orthogonally adjacent tiles, you simply score 1 point. If there are other tiles adjacent, first look at the row of the new tile and score 1 point for all contiguously adjacent tiles in this row. Then look at the column on the new tile and score 1 point for all contiguously adjacent tiles in the column. Yes, you will score the placed tile twice… Then, go back to the planning lines on the left and move over the rightmost tile of the next fully completed row and repeat the scoring procedure. Do this until you have finished all completed rows.





Before the phase ends, you must also score your floor row. Each occupied space in this row will score NEGATIVE points – the actual negative value for each space is printed on top of the space. You can never drop below zero points though… At this point, you now discard all tiles left on your planning side that do NOT have a tile in the rightmost space. Any rows which were incomplete remain in their partially filled state for the next round.



Now check to see if the game is over. If any player has completely filled any of the five rows on his colored wall, the game will move into final scoring. Otherwise, you get ready for the next round. The new starting player takes the bag and places 4 new random tiles on each Factory display tile. If there aren’t enough tiles in the bag, when it is empty, refill it with the discarded tiles from the gamebox.

If the game has ended, there is a little bit of endgame scoring – this is nicely summarized in the bottom right of the player board. First, all players score 2VP for each complete horizontal row on their colored wall. Then, score 7VP for each complete column on the colored wall. Finally, score 10VP for each color that you have placed all 5 matching tiles of that color onto your colored wall.

The player with the most points wins. Ties go to the player with the most completed horizontal lines on their colored wall.

My thoughts on the game

Azul is a fascinating tile drafting game. I find the game to be quite beautiful and visually pleasing, and the strategy of the game play matches the appearance. At the start of the game, I often will settle for combinations that give me large numbers of tiles or sets which finish out a specific row on my board. However, after the first few rounds, you have to start considering the placement of your older tiles as this can lead to huge scoring opportunities.

As your colored wall fills in, you also have to consider how the restriction on tile placement on the left comes into play. After a few plays of the game when you’re more familiar with the mechanisms, you may also want to start considering what your left-hand opponent wants to draw because it can be just as valuable to deny him wanted tiles if you have equal options.

There is actually a bit of interesting strategy behind deciding to be the first to draw out of the center. You will pick up the start player cardboard chit, and this will give you a -1 VP penalty for sure. Of course, you do get to choose first in the next round, and this is a nice balancing decision from the designer. However, not that the real cost of the tile may actually be as much as -3VP because the tile occupies a space on your floor row.

The game feels a little different with 2p as opposed to 4p. In a 2p game, each tile draw has a direct effect on your opponent. It’s a very strategic thing, and you can often play the turns out in your head to see how a round will finish out. I have found it much more difficult to predict how the rounds will turn out with 4 players in the game. Furthermore, there is a bit of binding in the 4p game as your choices do not really affect the choices of anyone except your left-hand opponent. Thus, varying player ability can affect the outcome of the game.

So far, all of my games have ended in five or six rounds. The reason for this is that it is generally not a problem for someone to get a tile to fill the top row on their planning board, so it is quite likely for at least one player to move a tile over each round. Be sure to consider this in your planning because the end comes up quick on you! Once you get to round 3, you need to really be looking at how you are going to score points. Getting a 7 or 10 VP bonus for a complete column or finishing out a column can be huge.

One thing that I was worried about when I first read the rules was that players would all try to go for the same strategic placement of tiles as each player has an identical pattern on their board. I’m glad to say that placing your initial tiles in the center isn’t necessarily a huge advantage, and in practice, it’s nearly impossible for people to go for the same things at the same time. In any event, the backside of the player board gives you a colored wall that is itself blank – allowing the players to place their tile on any space in the corresponding row. However, you are restricted from repeating a color in a vertical column. I have only played this side once so far, and it was a bit different – but not overly so. I had mistakenly thought that this alternative board was the “expert” side – but after discussing this with the Plan B folks, they claim that it is merely an alternate side, not necessarily more complex than the colored side.





The components are excellent. The tiles have a nice heft to them and they are nice to handle. They are smaller than the hex tiles in Hive, but they remind me very much of those; though perhaps the ones in Azul are a bit denser. The individual player boards keep clutter to a minimum, though the one gameplay issue (small) that we have found is that it is harder to easily track scores. Our group has made a habit of simply announcing our scores out loud in each cleanup phase. Realistically, if I need to look at an opponent’s board, it’s only my LHO as I’m trying to specifically deny them a color or leave them a color that they can’t use. Aesthetically, I do wish that all five tile colors had patterns on them. The blue and red tiles are plain while the other three (white, yellow, black) have a pattern on them. Also, it would have been nice for the start player tile to have actually been a tile instead of a cardboard chit. Sure, it functions the same. But, it would have matched all the other bits on your table/board then.



The game is super easy to teach. It’s one of those games that you can teach others how to play after only your first game. There are only 2 options in the drafting phase, and the scoring itself is not that complicated. The end game scoring is nicely summarized on the player boards, and that’s all you need to know! Sure, there is plenty of advanced strategy that could be employed, but at its simplest, you can just look at the table, pick the tiles that seem best for you, and play in your own sandbox after a three minute game explanation. That’s why I think that this game will be a perfect gateway game, and one that I would not be surprised at all to have a Spiel des Jahres nomination/recommendation come next May. There is a certain ease and elegance to the rules, a certain beauty to the components and a surprising depth of gameplay to the game that will tick all the boxes that I think of when thinking about such awards.

Tema 189: Personal Goals?
Pregunta:
So I just watched a review of the game Remember Our Trip, and it got me thinking how that game, and many others of course, use personal goal cards in order to gather additional points to get ahead of the other players. Would this be feasible? For example, drawing a tile arrangement in a specific order and shape would give more points depending on complexity of arrangement. I have played Azul over 20 times, and even though it feels to me each game is similar there would have to be something additional to make each game separate from the other enough to feel like a more complex game.

What are your thoughts?

Respuesta 1:
I think this is feasible. Actually, Azul: Crystal Mosaic adds boards with different goals/spots.

Tema 191: game record notation
Pregunta:
Hi all!

I bought Azul a little before Christmas and I am loving it!
... To the point that I want to re-play some of my games, study the movements and explore alternatives. The first step to do all this is to have a record of the game.

I didn't find anything, so I sat down and created a specification and a notation that can be used to record a complete game.

If interested, you are welcome to take a look: https://github.com/zvr/azul-record
I've also have a couple of examples games there.

Take care,

In all seriousness, I tossed mine. I have the base game, alternate tiles, joker tiles, acrylic overlays, and custom 3d printed accessories all in the main box but only by ditching the insert.

Respuesta 4:
I replaced mine with the cardboard lining that comes in the   box, since the new boards and overlays won't fit with the insert.

Then again, other than the factory tiles, there is really nothing in this game that requires any organizing that an insert can provide. If you really want to, you could make some kind of foamcore "pocket" or deckbox to bundle the factory tiles together, but everything else is already organized and ready for play.

Also not what is intended. The used tiles are supposed to be open information and part of the strategy of what you might pick. If you see a large percentage of the 20 red tiles already in the discard pile, you might think twice about trying to fill your five-spot row with that color towards the end of the game.

No harm in double-bagging, but it does remove that element of the game.

Oh right! It's been a while since I played. I was just remembering the "hassle" of pouring the tiles from the box into the bag (hassle in quotes because, how hard is it really?!?). Totally forgot about the benefit of being able to SEE the used tiles!

I'm a double bagger and I'd argue that it does not remove that element of the game. You can always look at an opponents board and figure out that if they have a tile on the bottom row that 4 more of those have been removed from the game. Or "oh man, they've done all their red tiles, guess I don't have much hope of filling my five row with red tiles." It's true that you're not accounting for floor tiles at all, but that should probably be pretty negligible.

It's real, so big that it's borderline problematic to play (which I personally love for a 'giant' edition), and it's very pretty. I have a handful of giant edition games and this is the only one that ever makes it to the table. It was a special made-to-order one-time thing I believe so not too many copies exist and I imagine the type of person (like me) who bothered to pay so much for a pre-order is probably not letting go of it very easily.

Respuesta 6:
It was double the size, requiring double the table, double the arm length and about sextuple the wallet. Hard to believe it wasn't in huge demand.

You may have something with Azul Gnat though?



Tema 194: Banter Reviews: Azul
Pregunta:
A competitive tile collection game where big combos and keen observation are key to constructing the best patterned wall.

Players: 2 - 4
Time: 15 - 20 minutes
Complexity: Easy


Gameplay: 10/10
Azul is an easy game to learn, setup and play. I’m going to briefly describe how the game plays, but most players are able to play right out of the gate.

Each player has their own board and scoring marker. The play area has a number of discs forming a ring, which holds the tiles players select. Each disc receives 4 randomly drawn tiles from the bag every round. A white first player token goes inside the area formed by the ring of discs.

You spend your turns drafting tiles from one of the various discs (or the central area), selecting all of the tiles of one color and placing them on your player board filling in your rows with a single color at a time. At the end of each round, rows that are completely full move onto the patterned scoring wall of your board, where points are scored depending on the number of tiles adjacent to the one you just completed lay.

Players can receive negative points by drafting tiles that they cannot use. Not being able to use a certain colored tile comes down to two rules: You cannot fill a row that already has a color that is different than the one you are trying to place. And, you cannot fill a row that was already completed previously by that color tile.

Play will end when one player completes a whole row in their patterned scoring wall. Bonus points are awarded to players who have completed rows and columns in their patterned scoring area as well as collected a single color in every row/column (but not in the same row/column - like the number’s game Sudoku).



Components: 9/10
Azul is a master at simplicity, and that simplicity is also represented in it’s components. The main component of the game, the colored tiles, are easy to distinguish from one another and have a nice weight and feel. Oddly enough, some people have even considered the tiles appetizing, which might be a new sensation amongst board gaming. Please, resist your urge to eat the pieces.

The rulebook is short and sweet, with a number of examples that help explain the game’s core concepts. The player boards are well designed and easy to understand. It is even easy to look at other player’s boards and evaluate their goals.

The box has an organizer, which is probably intended to take up dead space rather than organize anything. But, I should mention the box can be vertically stored.

There isn’t anything poor about the components, but it would be nice to see deluxe boards with recessed slots for your tiles. Placing a completed row into the patterned scoring wall would be that much more satisfying.


Overall: 9.5/10
Azul is a masterpiece of a game. It’s simple, short and yet has a lot of interesting decisions that player’s have to make. It’s one of those games that you may find yourself playing all night because you know you can do better next time (As long as Johnson stops stealing the tiles you need, leaving you with 10 tiles you can’t use).

Having good player awareness is key in the game, not only to ensure you get the tiles you need to score points, but to make sure you absolutely crush your opponents under crippling negative points - You see they can’t place any blue tiles? Stick them with all the blue tiles. Johnson needs just one more tile to fill a row? TAKE THE TILES.

As nasty as that sounds, it never actually feels that way. Players will constantly be doing this to one another, even if unintentional. No one I have played with has ever flipped the table over or shown signs of bad behavior as a result of this type of player interaction.

This could be because there is almost always another move or a chance to comeback next round. No one is ever completely out until the final scores are counted. And besides, these indirect player interactions are what help make Azul shine as a fun, gateway game. It’s easy to see what players are going for, and easy to figure out ways to stop them - even for new players.

Azul is a game that is easy to play often with anyone at any age - and has no issues at any player count. It doesn’t have a strong theme, but it doesn’t need one to be fun (For a long time, I thought it was a game about making Portuguese carpets but it’s actually a game about making a patterned castle wall - who would have ever guessed).

Even if you don’t typically find yourself playing board games, or maybe you think you’re too hardcore of a gamer, try Azul.

Tema 195: End game unfinished row
Pregunta:
Hi, we just played our first game and one player still had some tiles on the left side (unfinished row). We had a discussion of those unfinished times score negative points, like the floor tiles, or not? Can you keep those unfinished rows without negative consequences (except not scoring any points for them)?

Respuesta 1:
Yes, you don’t score anything for them, negative or positive.

Respuesta 2:
So far as I know, those tiles remain without consequence. The end-of-game scoring rules only add points for goals that you have achieved and make no mention of additional penalties for incomplete rows.

In the absence of an explicit rule during end-or-game scoring, I fall back to the regular rules for the wall-tiling phase in which those tiles simply remain in place for the next round (no positive or negative points).

Respuesta 3:
Thanks Martin and Chris! That's what we ruled as well since it's not explicitly stated. Now I can rubb in my victory even more

Respuesta 4:
Just remember that you aren't allowed to put tiles on the left side if the corresponding space on the right is already filled, so you can't use it as a dumping ground to avoid broken tiles on the last round (or any round for that matter).

E.g. You've already completed the red space on your bottom row on a previous round. Your opponent sticks you with three red tiles at the end of a round. The only row you've got open on the left-hand side is the bottom one. You can't dump the red tiles there -- unless you can fit some or all of them one of the other rows, those are all broken.

Having a safe space to put a big bunch of tiles is a useful precaution. It's why it's risky to complete a five-of-a-kind too early -- you then have no place to put those tiles and an opponent may be able to stick you for a big number.

Respuesta 5:
Quote:
Can you keep those unfinished rows without negative consequences (except not scoring any points for them)?
This quote describes the end of the game scoring:

End of the game
The game ends right after the Wall-tiling phase in which at least
one player has completed at least one horizontal line of
5 consecutive tiles on her wall.

It is normal that tiles may remain on the left after mid-game rounds of B. Wall-tiling phase. Nothing is stated to make this different in the round at the end of the game. Nothing is stated in the scoring procedure to reference them, thus it can be interpreted that no penalty scoring is intended.

Can I start a new line with a color that is not completd yet in a other floor line?

Lets say i take a single black tile from a factory
Can I place this black tile on the top single free horizontal space?

Or must I place this black tile at the bottom line, because that line is not completed yet or does this not matter and can I start as many lines I want from a color just as long that line was not completed before with that color

Tema 205: I played a combined game of Azul & Azul 3 today.
Pregunta:
Played a combined game of Azul & Azul 3. On your turn you take a move in either game. When you take starting player in either game, you are penalized on both score tracks. Final score was the average score between both games. I lost 91 - 101.5. This experiment ended up taking about an hour and a half. I'm considering incorporating Azul 2 into this but I'm not sure yet.

I'm prepared to stick my neck out and speculate that you're first person in the world to even attempt this feat. Well played indeed.

Choosing which subgame to move in adds a new type of decision (determining which is the biggest move between the subgames) that is not present by "merely playing both games" e.g. one after the other.

FWIW I've done this a few times with other games, and it's interesting. E.g. playing Go on two 9x9 boards, so each turn you play a stone wherever you want; it was useful for making one more aware of asking "Where is the biggest move?" (It might not be on the same board that the opponent just played on.)

Combining games (and analysis of combined games) is also a core element of combinatorial game theory.

It was an entirely new game experience altogether. On your turn you decide in which game to take a move - if I decide to take a move in Azul 1 then I have to evaluate opportunity cost of what I don't take in Azul 3. And vice versa, of course.



Tema 206: What to do in case of wrong placement?
Pregunta:
Dear all, we are using the Crystal Mosaic expansion but this problem also arises with the B side of the original boards.


Obviously, there was an error during that now prevents the light blue color from being placed.

The question is: should that light blue tile be added to the other two (even if they will not be transferred) or as a -2 penalty?

Thanks

Respuesta 1:
A past thread with some discussion of this sort of thing:

Respuesta 2:
My understanding of the rules is that you would have to do one of the following:
1. Place this tile on the floor
2. You add it to the other two and then at the end of the turn the right most is broken and lay on the floor, while remaining two goes to the box
Thus, it generally preferable to do 2., but is the case of the last round (as on the picture) it does not matter, one additional tile on the floor.

edit: I was mistaken initially

I understand that this is the official ruling....

offcial ruling, shared above says otherwise....

Respuesta 6:
I see they say you put all tiles down on the floor - "In this case, you must immediately place all tiles of that pattern line in your floor line."

Respuesta 7:
Per their official clarification, this is the sequence as I understand it.
1) you add that 3rd light blue tile to the row (pattern line) to complete the row.
2) in the tile laying phase, there is nowhere to add that color tile to the wall, so you move all 3 light blue tiles (not just one) from that row to the floor. There would now be 6 light blue tiles on the floor......and the 3-tile row above would be freed up for other tile colors.

Is that how others understand it as well?

Edit: However, the rules also say:

"Any tiles you have picked that you cannot or do not want to place
according to the rules, you must place in your floor line, filling
its spaces from left to right."

So wouldn't it be an option to just drop that one tile to the floor.....since you 'do not want to place' it??....it would never be added to that 'pattern line'. It seems that you would only drop all 3 tiles to the floor if you completed he row in order to free it up (and use it for other color tiles). Another option, per the original rule book, would be to drop the one tile to the floor, rather than completing the row of 3.....this would mean locking up that row of 3 for the rest of the game.....since there would be 2 light blue tiles that could never be completed with a 3rd without a significant penalty.

Tema 207: Azul Review: An existential relationship crisis in a box
Pregunta:
Azul is a widely-covered game, so I don’t have a ton new to say about it mechanically. Instead, I’m writing this review to work out my feelings about not just Azul, but games like it.

The Premise
Azul is a tight, focused abstract game wherein you’re building a 5×5 tableau of up to five different colors of chips (which look like candies). On your turn, you’ll take all of a particular color/type of square chip from one of the circular coasters in the communal play area. Everything you didn’t take goes into the center, which players can also take from. The center gets progressively more enticing, but comes with a -1 penalty to whoever reaches into it first.

You’ll use your candies to fill out rows of 1-5 squares on a personal play board, and once the row is filled, at the end of the round you can push one of the candies onto the 5×5 grid, which is what scores you points. A color can only appear once in each row and column, which means that by game’s end, there are colors you won’t want, which creates strategic considerations beyond your own as you survey you opponents’ boards.

The round ends when all chips are taken, and the game ends at the end of a round when someone fills out an entire row on their tableau.

The Components
They don’t taste like real candies, so minus points there. Otherwise, everything has a warming aesthetic that is decidedly abstract but never less than pleasing. To many, it’s quite stunning.

I think the standard play board is also double-sided (that may be a more recent printing). The reverse side has a more advanced mode, which is a welcome change of pace for regular players.

"I’ll Always Be Happy to Play It..."
Azul is undoubtedly well-crafted. The mechanics and rules interlock into one of the more elegant and satisfying puzzles in the hobby. Azul will also have a wide appeal to numerous gamer types. It has earned its success.

However, I can’t help but feel that there’s something hollow here. Maybe I’m expecting too much. Azul is the palette cleanser between meatier games...right? It’s been treated like a "main course" at a couple meetups I’ve been to, and it’s frankly not a main course game. It’s never going to soar to the heights that so many more ambitious games in the hobby will achieve. Again, though, that’s likely expecting too much. It’s a great abstract that fills you up, so to speak, more than a filler without overstaying its welcome.

One more anecdote, though. A few times in recent months (online or in-person), I’ve been mulling over what game to play with a few people, and we settled on Azul. But I use "settled" deliberately, because it wasn’t the game any of us were excited about, it was simply the one that we could all agree upon. It’s the significant other you end up staying with for too long, not because anything’s wrong, but because you can’t find something wrong other than knowing that you’re not in love. But if nothing’s wrong, is it you? Are you the problem?! Is she actually perfect for you? Is your soul a black void where love goes to die, and you’ll spend your life wondering if you’re even capable of transcendent joy?!?! Is there a point to ANYTHING? COME BACK RACHEL, COME BACK!!!

*ahem*

Ok, so I lost that analogy a bit, but hopefully you get my point. There will always be room in gaming for games that everyone is happy to play. Azul is one of the current standard bearers for that type of game (and yes, someone out there hates it; I’m talking about the rule, though, not the exceptions). But I also see a weird downside occasionally with this type of game, because it’s safe, in a manner of speaking. I don’t play board games for “safe.” I play for excitement and hilarity and mind-breaking conundrums of both mechanical and interpersonal complexity. And yet, if you ask me if I want to play Azul, I will happily, and truthfully, answer yes.

So there’s just enough cognitive dissonance with that, that I’m not sure how to resolve it in a review. But hey, it’s only a board game, so if this is what I’m deliberating over, I’m doing pretty well.

Not Nasty Until It’s Brutal
Azul seems like a game where you can just stare at your player board, but savvy veterans know that – especially as you enter the last couple rounds – you should be looking at your opponents’ tableaus, so that you can angle to stick them with some massive glob of tiles that they don’t need, thus giving them a bunch of negative points.

One small issue I have with this design is that it goes from 0 to 100 in brutality in an instant. There’s no real in-between point. And it also means that the early game has a higher chance to bore players who crave direct interaction, just as the late game has a higher chance to horrify players who prefer to focus solely on their own tableau. I can live with this personally, but it’s very noticeable once you play Azul with enough different players.

Standalone Follow-ups
Azul has a couple popular standalone follow-ups, Stained Glass of Sintra and Summer Pavilion, and is likely to have more and more in the coming years. I haven’t played Pavilion yet, but have gotten to play Sintra on a handful of occasions.

Sintra is like your rebound relationship, the one who looks and sounds suspiciously like Rachel, but is just different enough that you convince yourself this time it will be different. Time has healed your wounds and you’re ready for love. Yup, ready for it at any moment…just whenever it wants to show up. Please?? I mean, you cleaned up your wardrobe and have been working out and everything. You’re on the right track, and there’s no reason you can’t take this next step with a beautiful game, er, I mean person, er no, I mean game, that is deserving of your love.

Just ignore that voice in your head saying that nothing’s changed and you’re doomed to die alone. Ignore it forever and just lose yourself in the stained glass pattern of her sweater...

Existential crises aside, the Sintra game is a cool permutation of the core Azul concept. It won’t make the game appeal to anyone new, but it will reinvigorate the experience for many who play frequently.

As mentioned, I haven’t played Summer Pavilion yet, but having seen some play-throughs and reviews, it mostly just seems like more Azul. More complicated, but the same basic ideas. It may be the perfect fit for those who think Azul is a bit too light, but again doesn’t seem like it’s going to win over new converts or turn away existing fans.

Who Won’t Like This
Jealous ex-lovers who see in Azul a cruel reflection of their own internal failures. More generally, it lacks any discernible theme, so if you need a narrative to latch onto, you won’t find it here. I’m sure someone out there is bored with the mechanics, but I struggle to identify a “type” that won’t like it.

The Verdict
To attempt to resolve the weirdness above, I have a mild issue with games that are pleasant but ultimately not too memorable, the ones where I can’t find a definite fault but also can’t get excited about them, the ones that get played more than any other despite being no one’s favorite.

However, Azul is super pleasant, enough so that it manages to leapfrog most of those concerns. Savvy gamers will watch opponents’ board for strategic possibilities, which gives it just enough interaction to remove it from the completely insular games in the hobby, and its length always feels just about right, separating it from fillers that don’t satisfy quite enough and others that are pleasant but overstay their welcome by 15-60 minutes. In short, it’s a puzzle I’m happy to come back to again and again.

Nicely-written review, thanks! As someone who knows exactly what you mean about 'lowest common denominator' games (I'm looking at you 7 Wonders), but actually *loves* Azul, I'll throw out a few thoughts.

Quote:

I know lots of gamers fall into this "main course" plus "filler" paradigm, but there are also many of us who don't. My ideal game night consists of 5 or 6 games of 15-60 mins each. Tapas gaming forever!

I actually disagree quite strongly here. The reason I love Azul is that to play it well you need to be looking at your opponents' boards on *every single move* right from the early game. There are lots more ways to make life difficult for your opponents than just the obvious one of sticking them with a big lot of tiles on their floor. It's certainly possible to play Azul more as a heads-down puzzle-type game, and many people will enjoy it that way (probably why it's so universally liked, as you note) but that's not the game I love.

That's also why I don't really like Azul as a 4p game -- it's more difficult to play interactively so the puzzle-part is emphasised. It's a 2 or 3p game for me, and even then the other players need to want to play heads-up too for it to really shine.

Interestingly, I hated both 'expansions' (they're standalone games actually) because they boosted the puzzle element with addtional mechanisms and reduced the focus on the interaction that I enjoyed in the original. I wrote (far too much) about that here:

Thank you for the well thought review!

I would add that one of the advantages of Azul is the zero setup/tear-down time, and the fact that right from the beginning the game gets interesting.

I agree that Azul's nastiness can sometimes make it a marmite game. I have had a lot of conversations with my wife on the need to be mean to win this game, or whether "panache" should be preferred (don't worry if you're not following). As is, the game is a revelation of player's preferences.

Thank you for the kind words!

If I grok your meaning correctly here (interesting use of the word marmite, btw ), this phenomenon always struck me as slightly incongruous with the types of gamers that I see really enjoying Azul. Martin correctly points out that it isn't just the final rounds where you can be watching your opponent(s). This is more true at 2P, granted, but can be true to some extent at any time.

I think many abstracts as a whole have this quality. I've been playing a lot of  , for instance, and it initially seems very insular and meditative. The theme certainly suggests something quite personal rather than combative. But especially at 2P (and to a lesser extent any player count) there's an intense tactical battle that can be taking place (and should be, if you're trying to win). And we could of course find numerous other examples where the 2P game is more feisty, but it retreats to personal optimization at higher player counts.

I don't see an issue with it personally, and in fact enjoy when a seemingly lonely experience reveals opportunities for such maneuverings. But it's also a point of dissonance for many.

Very much agree. Pavilion comes closer to addressing this, in that it's a lot meatier of a puzle, but it's still very abstract, and isn't going to give you thematic excitement.

But I hear what you're saying, and will be sure to explore Pavilion at some point (frankly, I think the only reason it hasn't crossed my path yet is COVID and a lack of in-person gaming, so I'm sure I'll have opportunities soon).

The drafting is pretty much identical, but how you use pieces and especially how you score is fairly different. It's also a lot harder to screw other people by leaving them a lot of pieces they can't use. If nothing else, the inclusion of wilds (which changes round to round) is enough to change things up. I find this much more enjoyable than the original game. I haven't played Sintra yet.

Tema 208: Floor Tiles as Strategic Reserves
Pregunta:
We are fairly new to the Azul world so apologies in advance if this variant has already been proposed. We tried it and thought it was fun.

As the rules state, on your turn, any tiles selected can be placed in the floor spaces.

These floor tiles will, of course, be worth negative points when the round is scored. In this variant, however, the floor tiles are NOT removed after scoring. Instead, the floor tiles can carry over from round to round.

After placing tile(s) on a pattern line on your turn, you may then transfer like tiles from the floor to that same pattern line. You may not add tiles to any pattern line other than the one played on your turn.

Removing tile(s) from the floor shifts any remaining floor tiles sitting to the right of the removed tile(s) to the left.

This variant does not change any rule applicable to the first player tile.

Here’s an example: On your turn, you select three blue tiles from a factory. You place one blue tile on the top pattern line (row A). The remaining two are placed on the floor spaces. The round ends and you score negative two points for the two blue tiles in your floor. AT THE END OF THE ROUND, DO NOT REMOVE THE TWO BLUE TILES FROM THE FLOOR. In the following round, you pick up two blue tiles from a factory and place them in pattern line D. THEN ON THIS SAME TURN YOU MAY TAKE THE TWO BLUE TILES IN THE FLOOR AND ALSO PLACE THEM IN ROW D. This completes row D and has removed two tiles from the floor. If you do not move floor tiles to a pattern line during a round, they continue to score negative points from round to round.

We are calling this the “BK Variant” because my son (his initials) had suggested we try it. We recognize that his idea may not be original, and will gladly refer to it by its proper name!

In the meantime, we would like to hear what more experienced players think.

Thanks!

I am unaware of any such variant having been proposed before. I suppose the variant will lessen the damage done when you get stuck with a bunch of tiles you don't want. You still get stung for the points, but you've got a batch of tiles you can use next round.

Whilst I can't think of any obvious problems with the variant, I do have a worry that if players are making such use of their floor spaces, you might end up with too many tiles in circulation, thus causing floor lines to become increasingly swamped.

That was my first thought. If unused tiles aren't being cycled out of the game (into the box lid), you will eventually end up with more and more tiles on everyone's floor line.

Maybe this can be mitigated by only filling each factory with three tiles instead of four each round, or by using fewer factories possibly.

Respuesta 4:
We have played the variant at 2 and 3 players. We have not found this to be a problem. Most reserved tiles made it to a pattern line within two rounds after being placed on the floor spaces. Although circumstances might dictate that not all reserve tiles could successfully be placed on a pattern line due to poor planning or luck of the draw, the floor lines did not become swamped. That has been our experience so far.

Tema 211: Una sugerencia de contar PV's que considero imprescindible
Pregunta:
AZUL tiene un gran problema en relación a la evaluacion justa del puntaje adicional final. No tiene ningún sentido que mientras las lineas verticales valen todas 5 (cosa justa ya que todas tienen igual dificultad) las lineas horizontales suman siempre 2, con independencia de ser de la línea 1, la 2... o la 5 (!?)
Sugiero que acabar la linea 1, valga 0, la línea 2, 1PV y asi sucesivamente... hasta la línea 5, 4 PV
Aún puede ser más equilibrado (y provocador!) que acabar la línea 1 descontara 1PV. Y luego la línea 2, +1 punto, etc y hasta los +3PV de la línea 5

Respuesta 1:
Have you tried that variant? How did it change the game?

Respuesta 2:
Interesante, pero no estoy seguro de que consigas el efecto que estás buscando.

Creo que hará que el juego sea más largo, ya que la gente trata de conseguir esa ultima fila y realmente no solucionará el problema del "equilibrio". Aunque personalmente no creo que haya un problema de "equilibrio" con el juego.

Realmente te sugiero que trates Summer Pavillion . Encontré que Summer Pavillion es una experiencia más gratificante.

Respuesta 3:
Hello Alexandre ... No, I have not tried the variant that I propose enough. In several games I have counted the final points in one way or another but, although in some cases the result changes, I do not dare to go further. Ultimately, the victory conditions determine the form of play and not vice versa
But what I sense is that some system like the one I propose makes the game richer, less obvious and childish, also longer and more intense. More tactical.
I really believe that AZUL's VP counting system is very bad and impoverishes a brilliant game in all other aspects.
Sorry my English ... I use the Google translator!
Thanks!

Respuesta 4:
Hola Ramón gracias, en mi repuesta a Alexandre hay alguna otra clave... No sé si me expresé bien. Realmente no busco ningún efecto concreto y además usé una palabra no apropiada, "equilibrar". No se trata de equilibrar, en realidad un juego como AZUL es siempre equilibrado entre los jugadores. Se trata de evitar un sistema de valoración final que obvia cosas tan determinantes como que valga 2 puntos la linea 1 y la 5 cuando la primera cuesta 5 fichas y la última 25
Creo que es un fallo importante de diseño y que empobrece las posibilidades tácticas del juego
Me apunto a tu sugerencia del Pavillion. Veré en BGG si vale la pena adquirirlo
De todos modos, yo a partir de ahora introduzco en mis partidas el contaje de mi variante 2:
Linia 1: -1PV
Línia 2: 1 PV
Línia 3: 2PV
Línia 4: 3PV
Línia 5: 4 PV
MIs cuatro partidas de ayer con mi compañera las jugué y conté así y considero que mejoran mucho el juego

Tema 212: When do you refill the bag if you have exactly enough tiles to empty it?
Pregunta:
"The player with the starting player marker refills each of the Factory displays with 4 tiles from the bag as in the setup. If the bag is empty, refill it with all the tiles that you have placed in the lid of the game box and then continue filling the remaining Factory displays"

This could be taken to imply that if there are no remaining Factory Displays to fill, then you cannot "continue filling" them and so the phase is already over. In this case the refill would not trigger until the beginning of the following phase. I hope this isn't how it works because it's more annoying to do it that way and it would make the game take longer.

Respuesta 1:
We fill the bag when you need to populate the factory tiles and there are no more tiles left in the bag to do so.

I'm not sure how when you refill the bag increases game length, but if it's something that concerns you, just refill the bag when you want, then as players discard tiles during the round, toss them into the bag instead of the box lid. Put the bag in the box lid to remind yourself that's what you're doing.

We use a flat bottom dice bag as a discard bag in our copy, so all we have to do is dump the dice bag into the draw bag when we need to refill the draw bag. Do a search for "stand up dice bag" to find one.

I would not do that. By waiting to refill until the bag is completely empty, you make sure that all the tiles are on the factories at least once during the game. If you do otherwise, there are chances that some tiles will not appear at all and some player may get stuck with rows to complete.

Happy gaming!

We fill the bag when you need to populate the factory tiles and there are no more tiles left in the bag to do so.

I'm not sure how when you refill the bag increases game length, but if it's something that concerns you, just refill the bag when you want, then as players discard tiles during the round, toss them into the bag instead of the box lid. Put the bag in the box lid to remind yourself that's what you're doing.

Remember my response was to the OP who said that the bag went empty after refilling the Factory Tiles. So according to the rules, I would assume you refill it when it's empty but you need to put out tiles.

Rules read:
If nobody has completed a horizontal line of 5 consecutive tiles on her wall yet (see End of the game), prepare the next round. The player with the starting player marker refills each of the Factory displays with 4 tiles from the bag as in the setup. If the bag is empty, refill it with all the tiles that you have placed in the lid of the game box and then continue filling the remaining Factory displays. Then, start the new round.

To me this implies that you only refill the bag when the bag is empty and you need to "continue filling the remaining Factory displays" not simply because the bag is empty. So if you refill the Factory displays and complete the task but the bag is now empty, you wouldn't refill the bag again until need to start filling the Factory displays again. This would include any tiles that were discarded during the round, since you refill the Factory displays at the end of the round.

Well, obviously we wait until it's empty. In no case are we re-filling the bag when there is still something in the bag. The issue is what happens when the very last tile in the bag is also the very last tile that was needed for the factory displays.

Quote:
'm not sure how when you refill the bag increases game length
Because if you do it one way, once the round is over, you have to add in and mix together all the tiles in the box lid before you can place any tiles on the Factory Displays. When you do it the other way, the round is over and you start placing tiles immediately. It's not gonna make a huge difference, it's really less than a minute, but just in general when a game isn't clear on the issue of "reset X the moment it is empty" vs "reset X only when you need something from it and it's empty" (a very large number of games don't make this clear), I default to resetting the moment it's empty so you don't have to pause the action while you reshuffle or re-mix or re-whatever.

Right, which makes it a different game than if you interpret the rules as:
1 - fill all the displays
2 - is the bag empty? ok, re-fill it.
3 - continue filling all the displays? ok, they are already filled so that's done.

I suspect this was actually what they intended but that's just a guess. I'm with you that taking it exactly as written it seems to imply the way you wrote it, but I don't think it's unambiguous either way.

Respuesta 6:
We refill the bag exactly and only at the moment when you need to pull tiles from it but it's empty, but from the rulebook wording I can see how you reached your interpretation.

IMO the goal of keeping tiles out until the bag is empty is to go through the entire bag, then reseed it as closely to the original seeding (20 of each pattern) as possible, minus any tiles stuck on player boards of course. This goal is best achieved in your scenario by only refilling the bag when it's absolutely necessary, because by doing so you hold out for as many discarded tiles as possible with which to refill the bag.

Respuesta 7:
Yes, you have it correct.

You only refill the bag during the "Preparing the next round" step, and only if the bag is empty, and only if the factories aren't full.

If the last tile completes the factories and empties the bag, you don't put tiles in the bag until the next "Preparing" phase.

Agreed. We allow checking through the discard bag to allow for this. This is the other advantage of not just returning the tiles to the one bag. The odds of a particular colour coming out change as the game progresses. If you "card count" you can improve your chances of winning.

Tiles are put out at the end of a round. For example, in a 2 player game, you're going to exactly empty the bag at the end of round 4 when you put out tiles on the Factory Displays for round 5. So if the game happens to last for more than 5 rounds

a) If we refilled the bag the instant it was empty, we'd only have tiles that were discarded through the end of round 4.
b) If we refill it when we need to draw tiles (at the end of Round 5), we have tiles that were discarded through the end of round 5.

If you think about it, if you choose option a), then the tiles you discard during round 5 have to wait for two cycles of the bag emptying before they get put back into the bag, meaning that some discarded tiles do not get recycled through the "second bag." If you choose option b), then then all of the discarded tiles will be put back into the bag, and all of the tiles that were discarded since the last time the bag was emptied will be recycled through the "second bag."

It's not going to occur often that you exactly empty the bag when refilling the Factory Displays, but in the event that it does, we don't refill the bag until we need to get tiles out of it to put on the Factory displays to insure that as many tiles get recycled as possible into the "next bag."

Respuesta 13:
OK thanks. The opportunity to decide between a) & b) seems to be a pretty infrequent occurrence and if it does occur, makes a rather marginal difference. Not enough of a difference that anyone I play with would give a toss about, but granted, a) & b) are technically different.

All I can think of is that if you collect at time A there's fewer tiles to round up than if you collect at time B. But yeah, that's not much of a difference.

Still, though, I've always thought the tile collection and bag filling drags the game down. It's a ridiculously small thing, but for such a beautiful game, it's a moment of delay and clunkiness. I've never understood why they didn't just give you 2 bags to begin with. Rather than go table to lid and lid to bag and bag to table, go table to bag, bag to table. All the annoyance (admittedly minor annoyance) goes away with a draw bag and a discard bag that switch roles when the draw bag is empty.

If I played the game more often, I'd find a second bag.

I'd rather deal with the annoyance to be able to see the discarded tiles in order to better strategize. For instance, if I can see that most of the reds are already out and won't come back into circulation for a while, I'll prioritize drafting reds.

But as you said, if you prefer less tile herding steps you can always get another bag. Large Crown Royal bags should work nicely.

Because the rare times it matters, waiting to refill does take slightly longer, because you finish the round and then there's one extra step to do.

Exactly. You just dump the tiles out the corner of the box into the bag, give it a shake, and you're good to go.

Respuesta 19:
I gotta put my two cents in here.

First, only refill the tiles bag when absolutely necessary. Do not fill it with discarded tiles just because it's empty. The factory-fill phase is over as soon as all factories are filled with four tiles. This rule may eliminate some of the perceived downtime the OP is concerned with.

Second, a lot of time is wasted in the by-the-book method of placing discarded tiles "in the box lid" after the construction phase. For Pete's sake, there is no governing body with legal authority enforcing the use of the box as the absolute temporary storage unit. The box lid is just a convenient vessel that makes it easy to see which tiles are used allowing for simple deduction as to which tiles are still in the bag. Pouring the tiles out of the box and into the bag is in no way a Herculean feat. It is however a mostly time consuming chore that some folks find just too long of an activity to endure. Just stop using the box. A lot of players have a second bag and use the discard bag as an already "refilled" tile bag. This does eliminate the "view at a glance" look at the discards though. I personally use a large, clear, plastic cup for the discarded tiles. At the end of tile placing, the cup is passed to each player to dispose of their used tiles. When tiles are needed, I just pour them into the bag. It takes about two seconds.

In the described scenario, refilling the bag immediately could cause more refills to occur during the game with fewer tiles per. More refills would lengthen the game. If time is the only concern, fewer refills (by following the rules) is the most effective way to go.

Also, and I'll reiterate, ditch the box lid for a faster method of refilling the bag.

How does it take slightly longer? Because there's a few more tiles in the box?

In a two player game you likely would not even get to refill the bag, as someone would complete a row in the fifth round, ending the game, eliminating the downtime entirely.

Respuesta 23:
Quote:

Because you have to pause the action next time through to stop and mix the tiles before dealing them out again. If you do it the other way, you can refill and mix while the action is going on, and then next time through you only pause for dealing.

No rules-braking was implied. Perhaps my phrasing could be different. How about. "when adhering to the proper procedure" as an alternate? I myself don't adhere 100% because I refuse to use the box lid for the storage of used tiles during the game which helps to shorten the overall duration of the event.

And, I probably should've asked earlier, what is the player count in the posted scenario?

I've only played four-player games so far, but they always go more than 5 rounds. Sometimes it's because one player sees another angling to fill the top row as quickly as possible, and moves to block it where possible, but most of the time it's because most players would like a little more time to finish personal objectives, and thus voluntarily avoid filling a row too early (unless they've got a good lead and want to end it fast).

Respuesta 2:
What I've found is the person(s) who cause a game to end after 5 rounds, usually don't win. I'm therefore puzzled by the folk who report games never going beyond 5 rounds. For me, the real issue is why a player would push for a 5 round game.

Agreed. If you are spending your turns grabbing the necessary tiles to end the game quickly, those are - in some cases - turns you are giving up that may be more optimal in terms of earning more points.

Obviously, if you are REALLY good, and the people you are playing with are not as good then this strategy could work.

Also, rushing to finish a row because everyone else is doing the same thing is also a bad reason for this because rows are only worth two points in the end game. You could easily make up for this [and then some] with a regular tile placement somewhere else on the board.



Tema 215: Dumb question: why not play 3 and 4 player games with 5 factories only?

You can play however you want if it makes the game more interesting or fun for your group.

Personally, I like that the game has a variable end game condition (and I believe it was an intentional design choice). If you are playing a very tight/efficient game then it would benefit you to end earlier whereas someone who is playing the long game would benefit from the game going longer. Given your play-style, you can make decisions that hinder other players in order to shorten or lengthen the game to help your style of game-play. This adds an another interesting decision to your thought process when deciding what to do on a given turn.

Not sure what you mean by "the random round", but if you reduce the number of available factories and end the game at 5 rounds, you can expect the scores to drop significantly.

That's considering that no one was interested in only taking the 1st player tile, which I'm sure is a completely valid move. And when I say "valid" I mean "legal", not necessarily "viable".

I have always put the 1 tile in the center to start and treated it as a normal tile, so it would be whoever's turn it was when the other tiles ran out. Or whoever wanted to lose a point to go first.

More likely in a 2-player game than a 4-player, but I think it is safe to say, "This scenario will NEVER organically present itself for the entirety of human existence."

You wait (patiently?) for the following rule to take effect:

If the bag is empty, refill it with all the tiles that you have placed in
the lid of the game box and then continue filling the remaining
Factory displays. Then, start the new round.
OP already indicated that no tiles were left in the box or bag.
I don't see the word "box" in the OP.

Respuesta 6:
Imagine that all 20 reds come out in the 1st deal and all are assigned to incomplete rows in Round 1. Red would then be completely locked out for the rest of the game and nobody would ever be able to complete a row. Interesting game.

I don't see the word "box" in the OP.
Nonetheless it seems sufficiently evidently implied by the scenario described of an unlikely (yet clearly possible) deadlocked color.

Respuesta 8:
There are 20 tiles of each color at the start.
If you had 4 players all trying for the same color on the bottom (5-tile) row, that could tie up as many as 16 tiles.
The rest of that color could be easily out of play if players had used that color to place spots on their wall above the bottom row.
But in order for that to happen "midway in the game", even with bag refills to come, these would all have to include all four in the top row so that none of that color were put into the recycle. (We use a bag rather than the box lid.)
In that case, you're all just out of luck and will not be able to finish that set.

Tema 219: After more than fifty two-player games, Azul's end-game trigger requires a house rule to keep the game interesting.
Pregunta:
Context: I am speaking specifically about the two-player game, as that is the only player count at which I find Azul to be an interesting game.

I have played Azul with two players at least fifty times since March - it has become the go-to competitive game for my primary two-player gaming partner and me. We have both reached a very high level of skill at the two-player game. It is a brilliant design - you have to find the balance between taking the best move for yourself versus taking the move that hurts your opponent the most and every single decision during the game influences the outcome.

Speaking of balance: one of the most balanced parts of the game is the distribution of the colored tiles. Each color has twenty tiles and to get the bonus ten points at the end of the game for placing a given color five times requires that a player collect fifteen tiles of that color over the course of the game. This is quite a difficult task and payers are handsomely rewarded for completing it.

The new house rule that I'm eager to incorporate is that the game always ends after five rounds - irrespective of whether or not a player has placed their fifth tile in a single row. In each of the games that my gaming partner and I have played into a sixth round, the winner always seems to be the player who gets the more favorable draw of tiles during that round. The balance provided by the equal distribution of colors is thrown out of the window by a seemingly arbitrary end-game trigger. I have been both blessed and cursed by the ability to stretch the game into round six and with the draw of the tiles in that round having such a massive swing on the final score, I feel as if all of the decisions made during the first five rounds are meaningless.

Has anyone else incorporated such a house rule? If so, how has it impacted your enjoyment of two-player Azul?

Respuesta 1:
I'm pretty sure my 2p games always ended after 5 rounds anyway.

Respuesta 2:
It is extremely unlikely to not finish the game in the fifth round. I actually wished it happens more often and that there is a real decision to finish off not the game. I is almost always beneficial to art least one player to finish.

Btw. I think, after 50+plays, that colour bonus is not that great for what it requires to be met.

Respuesta 3:
Do you use the fixed board layout or the opposite variable layout? I think that would introduce more elements to the game because you may need to plan things out more without knowing what your final board state will be in.

Also, wouldn’t the swing be the same if it just happened in the fifth round? Not sure what problem the variant solves.
In 2p game you draw exactly 100 roles within five rounds. So, no there is not seeing in colour distribution in the 5th.

@Wildgift

With two players the tiles aren't reshuffled, all tiles appear exactly once. In a sixth round things go rather random. (I find this to be one of the design weaknesses of Azul which still does not make it a bad game.)

Respuesta 6:
I think Azul is near perfection in game design. It's a simple, easy to learn/teach abstract. Even with the "luck factor" calculated in, there is a lot of deep and subtle strategy to be realized/learned/exploited. Azul also has potential for some great drama/tension/excitement.

Most 2p games of Azul end in the fifth round. This is the norm. It's okay. There's nothing wrong with that. But I personally love the game of "chicken" that's played in the fifth round. Will my opponent or I end the game? Both player's have to agree to extend the game or it doesn't happen. Will we voluntarily extend the game to a sixth round where the OP's problem seems to be? A player may grab a tile early in the 5th that will force the game's end only to find that they're now going to lose as a result. The sheer randomness of the tiles distributed during the sixth round may cause a swing in the lead. That's gaming. That's fun.

IMO If it ain't broke...

We observed early on that the bonus points for completing a column were much more important than the bonus points for completing a color, simply because finishing a column is much easier to accomplish. And as you work to finish a column, you can collect tiles that are immediately adjacent to the column so that you maximize your point gain each round. You always want to complete at least one column; if you are able to complete two columns and you stay reasonably close to your opponent in points earned each round then you definitely remain competitive all the way to the end of the game.

We have played all of our games thus far with the fixed layout. I suspect that we are at a point where we need to advance to the opposite board to make the game feel more fresh.

Sarah (she-her)
@Wildgift
I guess that happens at our higher player counts then.
Yeah with two players, assuming that the game ends at the end of the fifth round, you go through exactly one-hundred tiles. If you play with higher player counts then you are reshuffling the tiles (potentially multiple times) throughout the game.

Azul is probably okay at three players, but I've played in the past with four players and it is virtually impossible to plan for future moves since three other players will take their turn between each of your turns and the game is extremely prone to AP at that player count.

As the publisher, I think I can speak for the team to say we are very happy with the final published designed. Of course fans are welcome to tinker with elements if it gives more to their enjoyment of the game.

Personally I have played 400+ games of Azul (Mostly at 2p). I have found it has been the personalities of players - min/max people tend to push away from finishing the game at 5 because it means they can score a dozen more points. Some want to extend the game to get those high scores. I have also seen very competitive people ruthlessly aim to end the game when they perceive an advantage. Azul imo is a mirror and reflects those playing it (see the hate drafts, oh my gosh see the hate drafts).

Either way, you do you! I am curious to hear if others in the community use this and their results.

You mention hate drafting and ruthless play to end the game when an advantage is perceived - this is exactly how we play the game. We find ourselves in the late game pausing to consider our relative positions after adding end-game points which will universally influence whether or not one player or the other tries to end the game. And often when one player hate drafts the other will say something to the effect of, "Wow, you are SO petty." It is great fun!

If I don't like the randomness of a sixth round but I also want to preserve the current rule set then I have to accept that forcing the game to end after round five is something that I must be mindful of. The inherent problem here is that if I am the only player to make selections that ensure the timely end of the game then inevitably I will have to make one or more selections that will not maximize my round-by-round point gain and with the zero-sum nature of two-player games I will therefore directly help my opponent in the long term. Assuming that both players are at an even skill level, if I always play this way then my opponent should always have an advantage. The only way that I see to avoid this is to establish a constant end-game condition.

And your partner is in the same boat. I don't think this is an inherent problem of the game, just an additional dimension to what you believe the game comprises (or want the game to comprise), and an interesting one, e.g., when it comes to drafting aggressively to tie your opponent's hands (rational "hate" drafting).

If it's without any other reason then I can understand why it's called hate drafting. I can just rarely see this in Azul. Whenever someone takes an action that hurts an opponent is almost (?) always to the benefit of the given player. The worst case I experienced was when a player could decide between two options that were the same good/bad for them and chose the one that kicked the player that was already way behind the others even more in the dust. It was not a nice move, but still a reasonable one.



Tema 220: Problem with Azul player boards
Pregunta:
So I bought a copy of Azul off Mercari and was sent a copy that looked new. It wasn't until later when I went to play it that I realized that the player boards have the beige squares on both sides. They don't have a side with the filled-in colored squares. Does that mean this is a counterfeit game?

I tried contacting the company to see if I could buy replacement boards a couple weeks ago, but didn't hear back from them. I don't know how common this problem is. I have read that there are a lot of counterfeit copies of Terraforming Mars out there...

So I guess I'm wondering what would you do in this situation. Thanks in advance for your help!

Respuesta 1:
It's certainly suspicious; there's been considerable evidence of counterfeit games revealed on BGG.

Respuesta 2:
Everything else looks identical. Tiles and cardboard cut-outs are all perfect and you'd never notice a difference.

We ended up getting another copy to give as a gift to someone and that copy, which has the colored side of the player board, has a slightly different-looking picture on the top of the box (colors slightly off, although the "imitation" box almost looks nicer...)

I doubt it could be a printer error or something because I feel like I would have been able to find others in the same situation online, but from my searching, I couldn't find anyone else who had the same issue.

Tema 221: please publish a mini AZUL


Tema 222: Azul Solo Variant
Pregunta:
After weeks of searching, a bunch of unsuccessful tries, and a lot of reading... I finally came up with a solo variant that I like and seems balanced (at least for my way of playing). My criteria were :

- an AI with a simple decision tree but powerful scoring
- AI should be a real opponent and not a simple bot stealing tiles
- no "go for high-score" variant
- keeping the game main drafting mechanics and scoring system

Set-up

Identical to a 2 player game. Place the boards in front of you, the one on the right being the virtual player's area. Leave some space next to the right board for the virtual player's supply. This supply is meant to mimic partially completed rows in a less chaotic way.

Display 5 factories in a line. Keep space between the factories and the boards for the black market, or "center of the table" in Azul terms.

Virtual player goes first. Then players alternate as normal.

On your turn :
Play as normal !

On virtual player's turn :
First, look in the factories and/or black market for the biggest group of tiles. This is the one the virtual player will grab.

In the case there are several groups of the same size, virtual player will follow a priority list of colors. Use the current round number to determine the row to look at on the board. The priority list is then read from left to right.

Example : on round 2, look at the second row. If virtual player has to choose between three red tiles and three blacks, he will take the reds, since this color is read before black.

If there are several identical groups of tiles (same size and color), choose one like this :
- if there is one in the black market, take this one;
- else, take the one from the leftmost factory.

Then, add the tiles of the same color that the virtual player may have in his supply.
Then, try completing a row, starting from the lowest one. If the tile of the correponding color is already placed on the wall, you must go up to the next row.
If you have too many tiles to fill a row, leave the extra tiles in the supply.
If none of the rows can be completed, leave all the tiles in the supply for future turns.

Example : virtual has collected 3 red tiles and already has one in its supply. With his 4 tiles, he can try completing the 4th row. However, the red tile has already been placed on this row. So, he will try on the 3rd row. If it's available, return one tile to the supply, and place the three other red tiles on the row, ready for scoring.

Then, virtual player immediately scores points, using the normal scoring system. The row on the left is immediately emptied, meaning virtual player can put several tiles on the same row during a round.

Virtual player never drops any tile on the floor, except for the 1st player token. Player who has this token loses subsequent points indicated by the floor, but goes first on the next round, as normal.

End game scoring

The game is over at the end of the 5th round. The bag is never refilled.

Add bonuses for rows (2pts), columns (7pts), colors (10pts) as normal, for each player.

Player with the highest score wins !

Hard mode :
If you find virtual player too weak, add one point per remaining tile in his supply at the end of the game.

A variant
This is another variant for players who want a fresh take on this solo variant or find it too easy (yes, those players do exist !)

I'm currently reworking my Azul : Summer Pavilion solo variant and while doing that, I tested a slightly different decision tree for the bot that also works for vanilla Azul. You can replace the rules above by the following :
- AI will always target the largest group of tiles.
- If several groups of the same size exist, priority will first go to a group in the black market. If there are several largest groups there, follow the priority list of colors given by the current row number.
- If there are no largest groups in the black market, follow the priority list of colors given by the current row number to choose among the factories.
- If several groups of the same size and color exist in factories, select the leftmost one.

Adding the priority to the black market results in a more defensive game, it's harder to trick the bot into grouping tiles for your own benefit. It will also go first player more often.

Hey there, I love the look of this variant. I have a quick question though. Say the virtual player just picked up the first tile of the game and its 3 reds. Will he automatically fill the 3 line, or will he have to wait to get 5 reds to start with the bottom line? Thanks.

Also, does the virtual player keep their supply between rounds? Thanks.

My reading of it is that the virtual player will fill the 3 line and immediately score a point for placing the red tile. If they have three red tiles later in the game, they will not be able to place on the third line, but will work backwards to 2 and then 1, if 2 is also filled.

I played that the virtual players keeps their supply between rounds. My assumption is that it works the same way as leaving a partial line on the board after scoring. The result is that the end of round is pretty much a non-event for the virtual player except they might get two turns in a row if they end the previous round and have the start tile.

After two plays, I find the virtual player to be really difficult to beat. It may be that I misinterpreted these rules. It's really hard to deny the virtual player points so my strategy is to try to limit them to disconnected tile placements so they score one or two points at a time instead of 5 or 6. Trouble is, that just delays the inevitable. Gonna play a few more times to see if I can find a better strategy. This is a fun variation!

Respuesta 6:
I think the automa is overpowered, I have played this six times and have never been even close to beat it.

Respuesta 7:
You'll have to take care, what the automa will get next, it will almost always fill the first three rows, but you should avoid the automa getting one colour complete and even (if possible) columns. That's thinky, but possible. For yourself, take care to fill columns and (if possible) a colour... doing so, I have a win rate of 50% after 10+ games...

Sounds like I'm playing it right then. Or at least I'm operating the automa correctly.

Respuesta 9:
It isn't easy, but definitely beatable. You really need to pay attention what you leave on the market and the tiles. It isn't a game "get the best option you can get" anymore.

Respuesta 10:
Hello all,

Sorry for the delay in response.

The interpretation of the rules above is correct : after AI picks some tiles, it should immediately try to put all of them, plus the ones in the supply of the same colour, on the bottom most row, if available, and then work its way up. It never waits for a better option.

It also keeps all the tiles in supply between rounds, that simulates the incomplete rows.

It is definitely beatable, it will almost always fill the first three rows, your job is to prevent it from getting columns and/or complete colours...
And do not let AI be first player too often, it's a huge benefit.

Thank you all for your interest in this solo mode !

Respuesta 14:
Hi, I thought I would pop in to say that this is one of the better solo modes I have tried so far (have not tried them all, yet, but I plan to eventually). This isn't necessarily the easiest solo mode to administer based on the extra rules, but the absolute easiest-to-administer ones are either BYOS, forces the player to have to think for two, or requires extra components.

I played one game so far and had a blast because the AI is indeed very challenging. I ended up winning my first game against it (I got 75 and the bot got 65), but understand based on the replies on this thread that a 50% win rate is likely the most realistic.

I do have a question, though:
This is my second game and I am suddenly confused as to what my next step is supposed to be (it's not uncommon for me to second guess my interpretation of the rules for any game; I don't know how I felt super confident the first game and am filled with doubts the second game).

Let's say the AI has just pulled two Teal Tiles and "realizes" that the two-passenger pattern line already has a corresponding representative on the Wall (you can see the two Teal Tiles queuing up just outside of the board).

Anyway, there are two possibilities here: 1) Break the pair and place one of them on the top pattern line with the other one being placed in the supply (currently the supply just has one Blue Tile in the upper-left corner of the board), or 2) Keep the pair and place them both in the supply as either everyone in the color group fills up an entire Pattern Line or nobody goes at all.

I think the response is likely the second (at least that's how I played it confidently through the first time around) because I think doing the first would very quickly trigger the endgame. I think I read in the rules that the AI will always try the fill the lowest Pattern Line possible and it would be very difficult for that to happen if there is so little caching/accumulation of the pieces.

Oh, wait....
@magicteddy

So, he will try on the 3rd row. If it's available, return one tile to the supply, and place the three other red tiles on the row, ready for scoring.
I guess I played it wrong. At some point I guess I confused the AI's supply that is supposed to be a temporary holding spot with the game's supply that gets filled with tiles that have already been scored. I guess my question now is whether endgame conditions remain the same as with the standard multiplayer game or whether the game goes to Round 5 regardless of how many horizontal lines have been completed on either players' wall. Earlier I had assumed that the game ends after the first completed row by any player OR after 5 Rounds, whichever comes first. I wonder if this was also incorrect.

AI's supply is indeed a temporary holding spot for tiles that haven't been placed yet. When AI scores tiles, one of them goes on the wall and the other ones go in the box lid, as usual.
Basically, this is Summer Pavilion's way of collecting tiles.
In your example above, AI should break the pair, place one on the first row (and score 2pT immediately placing it on the wall) and the other one in its supply, next to the blue tile.

I guess my question now is whether endgame conditions remain the same as with the standard multiplayer game or whether the game goes to Round 5 regardless of how many horizontal lines have been completed on either players' wall. Earlier I had assumed that the game ends after the first completed row by any player OR after 5 Rounds, whichever comes first. I wonder if this was also incorrect.
@magicteddy
End game scoring

The game is over at the end of the 5th round. The bag is never refilled.
Usually AI has the 2nd row complete by round 2, because groups of two tiles are the most likely to happen in factories. Keeping the standard end game trigger would be very difficult for the player.
The game lasts 5 rounds no matter the amount of completed lines (again, mimicking SP's fixed 6 rounds).



Tema 223: Azul component quality
Pregunta:
I am new to BBG and looking to pick up this game. I remember vaguely hearing years ago that some version had subpar components, but cannot really remember. Maybe it was another game.

Is there any version of the base game Azul I need to watch out for.

I am not interested in the other games in the family now.

Thanks in advance

Respuesta 1:
You need to be careful with counterfeits. There are reports of them on ebay and amazon, if I remember properly.
I would suggest for you to buy Azul from a boargame store (local or online) to avoid this problem. Avoid mass selling platforms, specially if it looks like it's super deal.

The only thing I remember about poor component quality was the first edition having a cardboard first player token that lots of people thought was trash and got accidentally tossed.

Piggybacking off this thread.

I used to own azul a year ago. The black scoring cube was made of wood and was small. The tiles were heavy plastic and you could feel the weight. I sold that version to a family member who wanted it.

I recently bought it again from amazon. It said “shipped and sold from amazon”. Not a third party.

The components are different and i was wondering if anyone has this version or thinks i should return it. The tiles are much lighter and feel like a cheap plastic. The black scoring tile is now plastic and noticeably larger than before (which i actually like. The wooden one from the prior version was very small for my parents to focus on and move around).

Is the new version I have the one most have? Is it counterfeit? Plastic black scoring cube rather than wood?

Thanks!

I received Azul as a gift for Christmas (purchased from Target in the US). It also has the cheap tiles, which is very disappointing. It sounds silly, but that makes a big difference when you’re playing the game.

It was purchased from one of the biggest retailers in the US, so I don’t believe it was pirated.

I’ll have to find an older version to buy.

Respuesta 19:
They have also changed the insert. The area for the first player token isn't deep enough to hold the plastic token any longer. Perhaps they put in old stock inserts from when the token was made out of cardboard? It's a shame. But to be fair, without two identical deep areas under the factory displays (one for the first player token, and one for the four scoring cubes) I don't really care. I store the five tokens in the area where it says Azul.

As for the overall quality of the newest printing I don't think the change is really that noticeable. It's such a minor change that when playing I can't don't notice the difference. It's only when I hold the drawstring bag filled with all the mosaic tiles I notice the change. My only complaint is that the change in production have had zero impact on the price of the game in retail.

I am unaware of any component changes. We don’t sell directly to Target (this is handled by a speciality vendor for mass market). Plus we have been assured Azul is a regular seller there, so I doubt that is issue of lowering production cost in an effort to make it more profitable.

Tema 224: Which Azul is best for 4?
Pregunta:
Which Azul is best for 4?

Respuesta 1:
I still prefer the original one and especially with 4 players.

Summer Pavilion has generally been preferred among most gamers I know due to the additional choices. However, the scoring there needs to be done sequentially which means in a 4 player game quite a bit of downtime until someone has arranged all their pieces and chosen their extra tiles.

The original moves along quickly and the scoring can be done simultaneously by all players. That's what I am seeking in a filler game.



Tema 225: My thoughts on Azul
Pregunta:
In an era of gaming that prides itself on beautiful sculpted figures, fifty different action cards, and artistic boards...

Azul hails as a loner in simplicity, elegance, and beauty.

Here are my thoughts on Azul.

Theme:
Theme goes along the lines of a king visiting Portugal, sees a beautiful tiled wall. He immediately asks his artisans to provide such a wall... which is where the players come in.

The theme is ok, in fact, I kind of don't care about it, because the game itself is so overly attractive and fun, you don't really need a theme.

Gameplay:
2-4 players will get a board to be placed in front of them with a tiled wall on it, with a score tracker on the top, and a pattern line next to the wall (more on that soon).

Players will then place cup coasters... I mean "factories" on the table. 5 factories for 2 players, 7 for 3 players, and 9 for 4 players.

Then the best part. A lucky player will dip their hand into a linen bag of goodness. Juicy, candy like resin tiles rest within this bag. Please do not eat them, I tried and you will pay for it!

These tiles match the colors of the wall on your player board.

4 Tiles will be placed on each factory for each player to pick from.

A player will choose only one type of tile on a factory, take all tiles of that type, and push the others to the center which creates a new central factory.

Players take turns filling the pattern line next to the wall. Once a line is filled, that line is "completed" and one of the tiles can shift over to the wall on the board.

I will not completely cover the instructions, but scoring occurs for tile placement, and the player with the most points wins.

Rules:
The rules for this game are very simple, and I found that cleaning the game up took more time than learning this game. I found that "learning as you go" is very effective and not one person I have taught has had an issue learning this game.

Components:
The player boards are nice and sturdy. I am so used to Terraforming Mars thin boards, but Azul has a thicker well made board that will last.

The tiles are just gorgeous! Every game I play with someone, everyone wants to take turns placing the tiles on the factories! It is a feast for the sense of sight, touch, and the clickity clack of the tiles bumping into one another, embraces the sense of sound as well.

I give full respect to the company for the quality of these pieces.

Overall:
Azul is a masterpiece! It is simple, fun, easy, and best of all...
You can play with anyone. From elderly folks to a 7 year old (my son beat me on the first game, not a joke!) anyone can play this game and have a great time. When you can bring people together like that, and have a good time, then it is simply brilliant! Thank you Plan B Games. And that is why I highly recommend this game.

Again... simply a masterpiece!

Happy gaming!

This game is amazing. I bought it when my 6yo son started to play games reasonably. I was aware of it, but always thought that this is a light-family game, and I usually play rather heavy games 2 player with my wife. It turned out that Azul can be a fantastic filler for 2, we play it 15min box-to-box. I still prefer it with 3 players, when I still have to control others' boards, but need to focus on my "wall" predominantly. The other gem which I bought to play with my son and ended up playing it with my wife as well is   which plays a bit longer and only 2 player. But, man, both games are brilliant!

Winning the Spiel Des Jahres means increased sales for a game, a lot of increased sales actually. For a designer it can mean that they’ve just poured rocket fuel into their career, for some it can also mean that they’re set making versions of the award-winning game for the rest of their career. Alan R. Moon has been happily putting Ticket to Ride versions out for some time now, and splendid they be. Sometimes its not clear how great an idea it is, with Azul there are now two ‘sequels’, its suggested to be a trilogy rather than an endless series, but those sequels are very much variations on the theme rather than expansions. Different enough that you might not like them if you like Azul, same enough that you probably won’t if you don’t. Still, that’s opening with a digression in what is ultimately a review of Azul, the very popular tile laying SDJ winner from 2018.

Gameplay is the sort of simply complex situation that gateway Euros and the SDJ in particular love. Each player has a mat representing a wall that they’re trying to tile. There is a circle of factories that fill up with randomly chosen tiles each turn, players pick the tiles from one or another factory and slap them on their walls. Completing patterns scores points, most points wins. That’s the simple and intuitive shape of the game. Then there are the complex parts, unused tiles pile up as point sucking discards, tiles are placed in one manner then shifted to the patterns in another, the way that tiles can be placed into patterns and scored is not perfectly straightforward. None of it is wildly confusing or problematic, its just about the right level of brain baking for a game of this type.

Azul is an abstract game with a slim theme laid on top. It is not like tiling a wall, just as Ticket to Ride is not like running a rolling stock company and Chess has little to do with the realities of medieval conflicts. There is little reason why a tiler would simply smash tiles to shards on the floor of the palace they were working in rather than do something more sensible with them, or why factories would foist useless tiles onto their only customers, or demand that customers only shop at one of them each day, week, month, whatever the non-specific time period covered by a turn is. Its not a big deal and its far less egregious than in some Euros with richer themes that are less well served, but it is a reality of the game.

The production is delightful, the tiles are thick and satisfying to handle and the patterns created are abstractly lovely. The systems of the game run smoothly and well, there are both simple and deep strategies available and its swiftly rewarding to play. There are many games that proclaim the, quick to learn and tough to master, label as a badge of pride. A game should actually ideally not be tough to master, it should have quick and rewarding heuristics available for players, a game being extremely tough to master is generally a sign of poor design. Azul is not easy to master on a first play, but it is master-able within a handful of plays for a focused and skilled player, which is a far tougher and more important needle to thread.

I’ve often said that there are things which lead a game to win the SDJ, table presence and the creation or presentation of a solid mechanic in a gateway format are two of the biggest. Azul has a solid table presence, accidentally or intentionally its tiles are the same size of Starburst candies, and the ability to swap one out for the other might have assisted its success. Its mechanics are a solid representation of tile laying, but its not an under-represented genre in the Spiel with Qwirkle, Carcassonne and Kingdomino all qualifying. That said, of the nominees in 2018 Azul was the obvious winner, Luxor was a nudge too complex to be a clear gateway game and The Mind while inventive was a little too left-field for the win. Azul is the sort of SDJ winner that its hard to argue against, but its not easy to argue for. It feels a little like Alhambra winning after Villa Paletti, but Azul is following Kingdomino, which is a Spiel winner that needs no excuses made for it. Azul makes total sense as a Spiel winner, but there’s not the feeling that its win was undeniable.

In conclusion, Azul is an incredibly solid game, it’s a tile layer designed using everything a modern game designer has at their disposal. It is an abstract, despite a thin spread of theme on top, but that matters little. It didn’t break the mold and it won’t set your gaming world alight, but it has everything needed to become a well worn favourite, if it isn’t already.

It should be pointed out that tile companies do foist extra tiles on you. Ever try to buy a single tile, they always come in boxes of 12.



Tema 229: Simplified scoring & jokers
Pregunta:
Hi all, here's a small variant ruleset I use when playing Azul. These are just houserules I use and your mileage may vary!


Simpler Scoring - Surrounding Spaces Only

Each tile you move over to your wall will score points as follows:-

+ 2 points for the tile placed; and
+ 1 point for each tile that is already placed on the surrounding 8 spaces.

Therefore the scores per tile placed will range from 2 (for an isolated tile) to 10 (for a tile that is completely surrounded).

Example: X is the placed tile; O is a previously-placed tile; E is an empty space.

O E O O
E E X E
O E O E
E E O O


There are 3 tiles in the 8 spaces around the X. Therefore placing the X tile shall be worth 2 + 3 = 5 points.

Comment: This variant make scoring a simple matter of counting 2 + 1 for each existing tile surrounding the placed tile. Points are easier to accumulate, and scoring spread will be tighter between players.

---

Simpler Jokers - No Forced Tiling of Jokers

I also use a slightly simpler joker tile method as follows:-

When drafting from the factories or the center of the table, the jokers count as their own color and CANNOT be drafted together with other tiles in a single action.

During wall-tiling, if a completed pattern line has both jokers and colored tiles, the player must move a colored tile (NOT a joker) to an available space on the corresponding line on the wall as usual. The only exception is if the entire pattern line is made up of joker tiles, in which case a joker tile is moved to an available space on the wall. As usual, a joker tile on the wall prevents the all-of-one-color scoring.

When removing the remaining tiles from completed pattern lines to the box lid, joker tiles are permanently removed from the rest of the game (they do NOT get recycled from the box lid). The rest of the joker tiles rules remain the same.

Comment: This variant makes the joker tiles more flexible and useful, in that they can be used to complete pattern lines without forcing the player to move them during wall-tiling (unless the entire line is made up of jokers). The trade off is that jokers are not re-used in the game.

Hi Michael,

Thanks for chiming in. What kind of reorder are you talking about? Distributors reordering from your warehouse? A reorder of another printrun? Something else?

The timeline for any of those can make the difference between "a few weeks at most" to "several months" until we see Azul back in stock in the US. As I have someone who really would like a copy it would be great if you can elaborate a bit.

Thanks so much!

Tema 231: Question on what to do in a peculiar situation
Pregunta:
What does a player do when the only color(s) left are ones that can't use? For example say a red piece can't be placed on any pattern because of other colors on that line and or when there's a empty pattern line but you can't place there either because there's already a red piece on the wall? Does the player have to take all the red pieces anyway and put them on the floor line?

Simply put, yes.

Yes, welcome to the Agony of Azul.

Respuesta 3:
Yes, they go on the floor line. That's a popular tactic in 2-player games. Stick someone with a bunch of tiles they can't use.

Respuesta 4:
FWIW that's not a peculiar situation; it's a normal part of the game. You simply follow the rules:

"On your turn, you must pick tiles in one of the following ways..."

"If you have picked up more tiles than you can place in your chosen pattern line, you must place the excess tiles in the floor line (see Floor line)."

Respuesta 5:
Yep. Hurts like the dickens.

Respuesta 6:
At least once your floor is full (does that happen much?) you don't get further penalized. Also the   package offers alternate floor penalties, including some that are zero point adjustments.

Respuesta 7:
Ahh that's some bull haha, Thanks for the clarifications. And Russ yes I know what the rules said but I wanted to be sure about this situation.

Respuesta 8:
A common rules blunder is to assume that a colour cannot appear in more than one pattern line at any time. No reason to assume the OP is doing this, but no harm in checking.

Then become the first player yourself. That is very silly critique of it. In my opinion it is best at 2 because you have more control.

I couldn't disagree more with this. I have lost quite a few games already from being constantly the first player. Don't forget you lose one point (at least) every time you get the 1st player token. It can go up to 6+ negative points.
Plus, here at home, we constantly change who starts the game and there is no pattern for the 1st player to win.

What a strange "criticism". Note that "easy to see a few moves ahead" is not at all "solved".

It's easy to see a few moves ahead in every good strategy game (including classic great games, which are clearly not "solved"), e.g. Chess, Go, Shogi, etc etc.

Being able to see a few moves ahead is a good thing, not a bad thing. If you could not see a few moves ahead, then on what basis would you be making your moves? You'd be making decisions randomly, with no reason to prefer one move or another and no idea what the consequences of your choices might be.


(And like others have said, I don't see a "huge advantage" for the first player, and even if there were such a first player advangage, it would not matter much, since in that case, the first player would change each round: the previous second player is usually the first to have an opportunity to take the first player marker in the new round, and would rationally do so if it were such a "huge advantage".)

Respuesta 10:
It's definitely cutthroat at 2, but that makes the decision space more interesting for me than higher player counts as you spend more time balancing maximising your own score against denying your opponent what they need. 2 is my favourite player count for this. Always find myself making interesting decisions.

The "advantage" (which ain't all that huge) comes at a cost. It also potentially advances the cost for later overages. Your friend is wrong.

"Tic-tac-toe" is solved in that two equally skilled players will always tie. Based on opening moves there is always a perfect response.

"Connect Four" is solved. There are mathematical formulas / proofs related to the game mechanics and the optimal path to victory. If you start in the center column you can always force a win, even with perfect play by your opponent as there are prescribed steps to take.

Azul is not "solved" in a similar fashion. There is no "perfect play" that will always result in a victory.

Respuesta 15:
Absolutely not solved.
I think it's a good game also in 2 players, you can also use an aggressive strategy for limite opposite player's possibilities to draft.



Tema 233: Interesting variation
Pregunta:
We have been playing a lot of Azul lately and came up with a fun variation to try on occasion just to mix it up a little. Instead of always placing four tiles on each station we used a random spinner to place either 2, 3, 4, 5 or 6 tiles. This isn't going to make you love the game if you didn’t like it before but as something new to mix it up we enjoyed the change. It gets especially interesting if you have a low round with 2 tiles followed by a large round with 6 as you end up flooding your board and there are times I had to take -14 points and had tiles flowing off my board in the Floor Line.

Respuesta 1:
Did you roll the spinner once per round and place the same number of tiles on each coaster? or did you roll for each coaster so that in one round they would all have a different number of tiles?......some with just 2 tiles, some with 6 tiles.

Respuesta 2:
well you can just ignore a spinner... and just place 2 on one, 3 on other, 4 on next, 5 on next, 6 on last etc. (based on player count) every turn for quicker setup

Respuesta 3:
Rolled the spinner each round which made for interesting strategy. On rounds where you only had two tiles per station you sometimes didn't complete many rows so had fewer open spacers for the next round. If the spinner game up with 6 tiles per station on the next round it really put you in a bind to grab tiles. It was almost best to take only one tile at a time otherwise you ended up with a lot of minuses. Not to mention there were a few cases where the last player got stuck with 7 or 8 tiles of one colour which they couldn't use.

The problem here is it may give too much of a bonus to first player.

Respuesta 5:
The reason is that spinning each round or for each factory may result in too little or too many tiles in the round. There are always 2p+1 factories, where p=players, right? Originally there should be 4 tiles per factory, so (2p+1)*4 tiles per round.

I'd make it very similarly, but more balanced:
1) Take 1st factory, it'll have 4 tiles.
2) For the rest – divide them into pairs.
3) For each pair roll a d6 die. (Re-roll if you rolled ). Put such amount of tiles to one factory and 8-roll to another one (to sum up to 8, which makes average 4).
4) Play. Now you should have (2p+1)*4 tiles per round, distributed randomly.

Respuesta 6:
We just kept it simple. Spin and put either 2-6 tiles on each station. Some rounds you end up with a lot of tiles some with very few. You must manage your own grid so you don't have too many tiles spaces filled when starting a new round or you are going to get swamped if it is a big roll and end up with a lot of minuses. As much as possible you need to move tiles over to clear space for subsequent rounds. We found it played fairly well with either 2, 3 or 4 players. It was a fun break from the normal method, which i like also.



Tema 234: Different preset mosaic patterns to use instead of the basic one (á la Sagrada window pattern cards)
Pregunta:
Have any of you thought of the possibility of having some sort of pattern cards to use as different mosaic patterns to fill instead of always using the basic one on the board?

I know that there's the "advanced" gray side of the board but I thought it might be neat to have different patterns with different levels of complexity that the players could choose to try and complete, similar to what Sagrada does with the window pattern cards, thus giving the game more variety but a bit more controllled than with the fully open gray side.

I noticed that the new player boards that come with the Crystal Mosaic expansion offer precisely that, two new different patterns on the boards, which made me realize that this is something feasible and also appealing to more people than me lol.

I've been searching here in the forums and I couldn't find anything on this subject but I can't believe I'm the first or only one that has thought of this possibility.

Anyone?

Respuesta 1:
Interesting proposition.

Sagrada player boards are designed with interchangeable pattern cards, so if you want to do something similar with Azul it would be quite clumsy to have to 'attach' a specific user-generated pattern to the Azul player boards as there is no slot to slide in the card. Best solution may be to have the pattern displayed on a tablet next to the play area for everyone to refer to and follow.

The idea sounds interesting, but I think the gray side already works fine as it is to 'forces' players to creatively adapt to the rapid changes in tile availability each round. But I'd be more than willing to give this idea a go.

Respuesta 2:
I really can't see that different patterns in Azul would feel that different to play. The variability comes from the draw of the tiles and the interaction.

Respuesta 3:
I was thinking about different patterns too. If we are to use different pattern we are supposed to have it identical for all players. But what if players use different patterns and not the same? Wonder how that will play.

Patterns in Azul boil down to 5 rook problem. There are many solutions, some prettier than others.

The new Crystal Mosaic overlays would help solve this. Put your alternate pattern on the board, then add the overlay. It should keep the card / paper / whatever you use from sliding around.

Depends on the pattern and the way you implement it. You could have all players use the same pattern or even randomize patterns for everybody. You could even go as far as implementing new end-game bonuses like Sagrada does with the public objectives. I know this might be tinkering with the original concept too much, and you might as well go play Sagrada instead (which I also own and love too) but I'm all for trying variants that inject new life to games I love so if it can be done, why not?

Tema 235: Puzzley Fun, We just don't like the Puzzle
Pregunta:
Azul - 2017

Designer: Michael Kiesling
Artist: Philippe Guérin, Chris Quilliams
Publisher: Next Move Games
2-4 Players Ages 8+ 30-45 Minutes
Drafting, Set Collection, Abstract Strategy

Components

4 Player Boards
4 Scoring Markers
9 Factory Displays
100 Tiles
1 Draw Bag
1 First Player Tile

Rule book quality and clarity

Good flow through the rule book. They have plenty of illustrations, diagrams with arrows and examples. Given this is a relatively simple gateway type game, they explain everything in great detail and layout it out well. The only issue I have is that it is a fold out book and so you have to flip it over or fold creases to look at certain pages.

How to Play

The game is setup with a number of factory offering tiles in the middle of the table depending on player count. You will then put 4 random tiles on each tile from the bag. In turn order each player will grab all of one design from either one of the tiles or from the center of the table. If they grab from a tile any tiles not taken are moved to the center of the table. The player then places these tiles on their player board in one of the five rows on the left, filling in the row from right to left. The restrictions for where to place a tile are as follows: you can’t split the tiles you take between 2 rows and you can’t put tiles in a row where you have already completed that design previously. If you have tiles left after filling the row they go to the bottom of your board on the floor line track, these will be negative points at the end of the round. The first part of the round will continue until all tiles have been drafted. Once that is completed players will simultaneously do the second part, wall tiling. Starting on the top row you will move over a tile from every full row you have to the corresponding design on the right side of your player board. You will score for each tile you move over. After the tiling is done you will check for the game end trigger, which is anyone completing a horizontal line of 5 consecutive tiles. If no one has you will reset the displays with 4 tiles each and continue the small round play until the end game is triggered. There will then be some end of game scoring with the highest score winning.

Thoughts

I will start by saying my biggest issue with this game and the reason we don’t play it anymore is user error and not a game flaw. We found quite a few times, sometimes too late, that we were grabbing and placing tiles in rows we weren’t able to. With the placement restrictions placed in this game we would keep forgetting to look and make sure we didn’t have them in this row. The game play itself is an interesting puzzle type affair. You find yourself counting out possible moves to see what you might get stuck with or to be able to stick someone else with. In that regard this game can feel more take that than the Stained Glass version. You can do it in both games but the passing mechanic introduced in Stained Glass allows you to feel like you have some control over it, even if it is just a small amount. So in that regard, the puzzly aspect, I can see why this is such a hit and if we could get past the wrong tile placing it might have stuck with us. However, the glass version just felt better for us. The other aspect I would like with this version would maybe be a round count, this game can be swingy with the amount of rounds and you could be trying to swing some big points and then someone just rushes the game end, another take that feeling aspect. Overall I would say it is a smooth and pretty design, just not for this family.

To be honest, I don't get how so many people are making this mistake since it never shows up on the rulebook.

Yep. Sometimes I'm working on the same color in three different rows. Perhaps the confusion is with one of the actual rules being: you cannot draft a set of tiles and split them between two rows. But you CAN draft the same color on a different turn and put them on a different row. This is a big difference, though, with what the OP stated. But as said, he isn't the first person to get that rule wrong.

What you described is the proper rule...you cannot place tiles on a row that match a tile already placed in your final tableau. That's not the mistake that is being described.

Suppose you have a brand new game, meaning no tiles have been placed. The correct way to allow placement - albeit not strategically very viable - is to place one blue tile on the single row, then place two more blue tiles on the double row, and then perhaps even place three blue tiles on the triple row. That is allowed. Some folks mistakenly assign the rule that once you have placed a blue tile on the top spot, you can no longer play any blue tiles in that round. That is incorrect.

My issue with Azul is scoring. The gameplay is fantastically simple. I've never had issues teaching anyone how to play, but scoring after each round is the hardest part for people to grasp.

Like you mentioned, the design is solid. This game is far from being one of my favorites, but it will always stay in my collection for how smooth and accessible it is.

Tema 237: 2 players question : casual or cutthroat ?
Pregunta:
Hello! My wife and I, we mostly own coop games to avoid mean confrontation. However, we do still own a few competitive games as you may see in my game list. Our favorite is Wingspan, but I really enjoy 7 Wonders Duel also.

The thing is, I am looking more and more at purchasing shorter and lighter games as I already own several games that take a few hours to play (Spirit Island, Robinson Crusoe, This War of Mine, Nemo's War, Aeon's End, Viticulture EE+ Tuscany, etc.)

My wife is not a abstract/chess fan (she hate Chess, Hive, Onitama, etc.), but she still enjoyed playing things like Santorini (she have no trouble playing Spirit Island in term of weight for a comparison.) We tried playing Azul: Stained Glass of Sintra at a cafe, but the guy did the worst job I ever seen at explaining the rules, so much so that we ended up just tossing to game aside and playing Pandemic instead.

Having said that, the appeal for me is that the base game seem pretty short, pretty, simple yet offer a good deal of replayability and was only 28$ everything included here, in Canada(shipping, taxes, etc.).

I am just concerned if the game requiere a high level of strategic/tactical planning like a Chess game or if it is more casual. Yes, I watched lets play and review, but your input is worth no less then the "official" ones.

Thank you!

Respuesta 1:
It's casual compared to Chess. But it can be a little cutthroat depending on the players. What people are working on for their boards is public knowledge, so you can choose to hate draft (meaning intentionally take tiles that you know someone wants even if you don't need them) if you want to.

Respuesta 2:
It’s casual, but there’s definitely space for it to be cutthroat. There’s is room for hate drafting and forcing your opponent to take a bunch of tiles they can’t use. It absolutely depends on the players. My partner and I definitely look for opportunities to be mean!

Definitely not a chess or Hive feel in the slightest for me, and I do not enjoy those games either.

Respuesta 3:
Azul can be cut-throat at 2P since with only 1 other board to monitor it is not difficult to play to deny the other player what they want and/or to ensure they incur potentially heavy negative points on occasions.
Whether it is too strategic for your wife I don't know, this post might help:

You can play Azul in a casual manner, but if you have grown up playing abstracts like Chess and latterly those you mention then, if you are like me, you'll find it hard not to approach Azul in the same way you play those games.

Respuesta 4:
Azul fits in the same category as Carcassonne and Kingdom Builder, which is to say it is what the players make of it. You can play nice or you can play mean and both styles work well. My wife doesn’t really enjoy petty mean moves (in the sense that you’ve chosen to do what’s worst for me instead of what’s best for you), but Azul doesn’t feel petty. It grants players the agency to take good moves for themselves while using the side effects (pieces moving to the middle) to impact opponents. It’s an ingenious way to let the game be player driven without devolving into destructive “take that”.

If you want to minimize opportunities for players to put each other in bad positions, Azul: Summer Pavilion is far more forgiving, but at the significant loss of player interaction.

Respuesta 5:
AZUL is cut-throat with 2 players.. as you can really mess up someone else plan. But if you have more players then you really don't know what others are going to do.. so you become more focused on your choices rather than messing up others.

Respuesta 6:
My friend and I have played perhaps 100 games of Azul 2-player. Which speaks to the replay question - it really feels like every game is subtly different.

And the same things go for the cutthroat angle - sometimes you just have to do something mean, and sometimes you do something mean without even noticing it until the other player says something. And some games you just don't get the opportunity to be mean.

The funny thing about 2-player Azul is the wild spreads that sometimes happen in points. For every game that ends with a spread of less than seven points there is a game which skews crazily and ends with one player on the losing end of a 20 or 30 point crusher.

The good thing is the game is quick and set-up for a rematch is a breeze.

Respuesta 7:
If you want less cutthroat, get Azul Summer Pavillion.

You can still hate draft, but you place your tiles at the end of the round (instead of when you grab some like original Azul) and can thus change your plan during the round. There's also a lot more ways to place your tiles, diminishing the competitive part of the game.

Tema 238: Box inset question: what's the inset under one of the factory tile insets for?
Pregunta:
The box inset has two insets for factory tiles: one where 5 tiles fit easily and another where 4 tiles fit easily. Under the latter there is another inset with the area of a resin tile, but it's not deep enough for this. What is it for?

I do read that the first edition of Azul didn't come with a resin first player tile, but with one made of cardboard. Am I right if I assume this tile was as 'deep' as a factory tile and there it would fit in that shallow inset under the factory tiles? And therefore, was that inset the intended spot for the first player tile? (And therefore, is it useless in my box?)

Respuesta 1:
Yes.

Respuesta 2:
Yes it was for the original cardboard 1st player token. I guess when they moved to a resin token, they didn't update the insert.

These days I use a home made (3d printed) token. Not sure where the cardboard one has got to.

Respuesta 3:
Put the first player tile in the bag with the other tiles, because you pull them out as part of setting up.

The indent below the factory circles is for the 4 score counting cubes. They fit perfectly.

But you only randomly draw some of the tiles from the bag during setup. Why force yourself to have to rummage around in a bag with dozens of tiles searching for the first player tile?

Respuesta 5:
It's either rummage for the first player tile, or for the 4 score tokens. Whichever you prefer

Yeah, the tile and score markers are kept in a small bag they came in (or if they didn't I added one). They certainly don't fit in the shallow indentation under the factory tiles, way too high.

Is there a new version of the insert then? Mine fit perfectly flush, which is why I thought that's what it was made for.

Interesting indeed. Mine has the same text in the Credits section on the back of the rulebook, but it's missing the logo under "Development by:" and the square tile slot in the tray is too shallow for the score markers or the first player tile. Sold in the States.



Tema 239: Small typo in dutch translation
Pregunta:
The very first word in the dutch rule book is 'azuleojos' (sic), which is incorrect spanish/portuguese. A mild annoyance, because it's the very first word and spanish is my second language, so I didn't like the translation before even reading two words!

Other than that, thanks for this great game. I'm enjoying it.



Tema 240: First Turn order advantage
Pregunta:
Is there an advantage to going first in the First Round?
Or is there no advantage at all?

Respuesta 1:
FWIW I've not heard of any empirical evidence showing a first player advantage (or disadvantage).

Anecdotally, in the Azul games I've played there was no obvious first player advantage (or disadvantage).

Respuesta 2:
I would say it depends on the tile distribution. If there is a factory with 4 tiles in the same color it would be quite advantageous to take that first. However, that's usually rare. Even just 3 tiles of the same color is often good but I have seen more than one spot with such an arrangement in the first round in most games thereby giving an advantage also to players later in the round.

That said, the effect should be so small to not really affect the end score. A possible variant would be to start the first player at -1 VP as if they had the first player token the round before.

Respuesta 3:
I think the biggest advantage is that they spent some time in Portugal

Respuesta 4:
I'm not sure there's a first player advantage but there seems to be a last-player disadvantage.



Tema 241: Taking tiles from the central pile before all factories are empty
Pregunta:
Hello,

Is is allowed to take tiles from the central pile before all the factories were emptied? (and of course be penalized with the first player token and minus 1 or 2 points)

Thank you!

Respuesta 1:
Yes. You can grab tiles from the center on any of your turns, but I think you have to wait until some tiles move there. You can’t grab the first player tile when it’s the only one there.

@rules
On your turn, you must pick tiles in one of the following ways:
EITHER
a) Pick all tiles of the same color from any one Factory display and then move the remaining tiles from this Factory display to the center of the table.
OR
b) Pick all tiles of the same color from the center of the table.

Respuesta 4:
Agreed. Strictly speaking it is 1st player marker and not a tile at all even if shape suggests otherwise. The concept of color is not applicable to it either.

Respuesta 5:
How is there a penalty for taking the first player marker?

Respuesta 6:
I just reread the rules. There IS a penalty for taking the first player marker. It goes in your negative points row at the bottom. We have been playing that wrong for a while now. We always put it next to our boards. Thank you BGG for keeping me on the right path.

@RandomShuffle

No, it's an actual tile. When you take it, it goes in the floor row at the bottom of your board and costs you a point. It's a mechanism to balance out the value of going first.

This seems a pointless semantical debate, but what the heck.
The rules always call it a "starting player marker", never a "tile".

And it is clearly not functionally a "tile" as "tile" is used in the rules: each turn you take "all tiles of the same color" from a location - if the "starting player marker" were a "tile", then you could take it as your turn action. Then the "tiles" you took are placed on one of your pattern lines, and later moved to your wall - none of which you do with the starting player marker.

Quote:

Agreed, it obviously has this function. But that doesn't make it a "tile" in terms of game functionality. That it happens to have a similar physical structure to the tiles is coincidence; the game would function just as well if it were a pawn or a disk, for instance.

Respuesta 9:
Who knew changing the token from a cardboard chit to a plastic tile would cause so much confusion? Be careful what you wish for I guess.



Tema 242: New player boards
Pregunta:
We finally purchased our copy of Azul from our favorite local game store. After getting it home and opening everything up we noticed that two of the player boards were slightly stuck together for some reason. Once pulled apart, they left some markings on each board. It’s nothing that impedes with gameplay, but I’m a perfectionist and it bothers me every time I look at it . Is there anywhere to purchase additional/replacement player boards? Thanks all!

Kind of the point of my post was to make sure that the OP didn't see a picture of the "collector's" tiles and think those were standard. I believe I remember there being teal and orange tiles that were released at some point. I was wondering if the OP thought they were missing *those* tiles.

Tema 244: First player marker
Pregunta:
After each round the first player repopulates the factories. Is the first player marker then replaced in the center or does the person who has it remain the first player for the rest of the game? Does that mean there is only a penalty point for drawing from the center pile only on the first round?

Respuesta 1:
You put it back in the centre.

You might consider that the first move of any round, other than the first, is that the player with the marker places it in the middle, ready to be taken by the first player to take tiles from the center in the new round.

Quoting two segments from page 3 of the rules, the section titled A. Factory Offer (with my highlight).


The starting player places the starting player marker in the center of the table and then takes the first turn. ...

b) Pick all tiles of the same color from the center of the table. If you are the first player in this round to pick tiles from the center of the table, also take the starting player marker and place it onto the leftmost free space of your floor line.



Tema 245: German Review mit80.de: AZUL
Pregunta:
My review of AZUL
originally appeared here:

http://mit80.de/index.php?/archives/292-AZUL.html



AZUL

Der in Achim in der Nähe von Bremen lebende Autor Michael Kiesling musste Sechzig werden, um sich 2017 als erfolgreichster Autor von der Essener Spielemesse zu verabschieden. Seine Karriere währt schon über zwanzig Jahre. Die Wenigsten wissen, dass er einst in Essen mit einem Kleinverlag startete, wobei seine drei Spiele im 1x1 Verlag nicht wirklich für ZÜNDSTOFF sorgten. Danach war er über lange Zeit Partner Wolfgang Kramers. Mit TIKAL und TORRES landeten die beiden gleich einen Doppelerfolg beim „Spiel des Jahres“ 1999 und 2000. Vor zehn Jahren zeigten sich erstmals seine Solostärken wieder, da nahm er den späteren Trend der WIKINGER-Spiele überzeugend vorweg.

Ganz aktuell ist sein taktisches Legespiel AZUL das beliebteste Spiel der Messe, zumindest wenn man GeekBuzz-Wertung von BGG und die Fairplay-Liste zugrunde legt. Beim GeekBuzz landete AZUL auf dem ersten Platz, die Stimmberechtigen der Fairplay wählten es immerhin noch aufs Podium, dort erreicht das Spiel den dritten Platz. Dabei blieb es aber nicht, mit HEAVEN & ALE (eggertspiele) verzeichnete er mit seinem Bremer Koautor Andreas Schmidt noch einen weiteren Platz in der Top-Ten-Wertung der Fairplay. Außerdem war er mit seinem gewohnten Partner Kramer mit REWORLD (eggertspiele) im Weltraum unterwegs. Schließlich schippern wieder einmal Schiffe auf dem Mississippi. Sein RIVERBOAT (Lookout Spiele) ist ein landwirtschaftliches Logistikspiel, das ausschließlich aus seiner Feder stammt.

Zurück zu AZUL. An Kieslings Idee lässt sich trefflich die aktuelle Marktentwicklung ablesen. Die kanadische Firma Plan B Games, die bisher nur durch den ersten Teil der CENTURY-Trilogie im Vertrieb von Abacus auf dem deutschen Markt auffiel, sorgte Anfang Juli für Schlagzeilen. Der Verlag um Sophie Gravel übernahm eggertspiele und erhielt damit Zugriff auf viele herausragende Kenner- und Expertenspiele. Peter Eggert kündigte damals an, noch drei Jahre aktiv an Entwicklung und Herausgabe von Spieleneuheiten mitwirken zu wollen. Das Kerngeschäft mit den anspruchsvollen Spielen wird den Hamburgern erhalten bleiben, die einfacheren Familienspiele scheint Plan B übernehmen zu wollen. Denn redaktionell ist AZUL von den eggertspiele-Redakteuren Viktor Kobilke und Philippe Schmit betreut worden und wäre sonst mit Fuchs-Logo herausgekommen. Vertriebstechnisch schwenken die Kanadier nun auch um und schließen sich Pegasus an, für eggertspiele bleibt damit alles wie gehabt.

Für den Start des in Deutschland noch unbekannten Verlags konnte nichts Besseres passieren. AZUL wird das Ast-Logo mit dem angelehnten „B“ von Garmisch bis Flensburg bekannt machen. Warum der Erfolg? Kiesling gelingt mit AZUL das, was 2016 Bruno Cathala mit KINGDOMINO erreichte. Beide Legespiele sind in wenigen Minuten erklärt, die Spiele selbst entwickeln dann genügend Spieltiefe, dass der Spannungsbogen für die notwendige halbe Stunde ausreicht. Auch optisch wissen beide Spiele zu gefallen, wobei AZUL im haptischen Bereich das „Spiel des Jahres“ 2017 klar schlägt.

Und die Haptik ergibt sich aus den 100 Azulejo, quadratische Fliesen, die im spanischen oder portugiesischen Umfeld aus Keramik sind und im Spiel kongenial in Kunstharz umgesetzt wurden. Etymologisch hat der Begriff nichts mit dem portugiesischem „azul“ für blau zu tun, sondern ist ein Überbleibsel des maurischen Einflusses, stammt damit aus dem Arabischen und steht für Fayence.

Die 100 Fliesen gibt es in fünf verschiedenen Gestaltungen, wobei zur Abgrenzung deutlichere Kontraste gewählt wurden als beispielsweise auf der Spielregel, deren Kachelwerk ganz in Blau gehalten bleibt. Zwei bis vier Spieler dürfen sich als Fliesenleger fühlen und eine 5x5-Felder große Wand nach Vorgabe oder recht frei gestalten. Jeder erhält dafür eine Palastwand, die sein Spiels steuert und seine Punkte bilanziert. Kacheln in der obersten Reihe brauchen dabei nur einen Musterstein, darunter wird es stets eine Kachel mehr, sodass in der fünften Reihe fünf Kacheln einer Sorte nötig sind, um ein Feld zu belegen. Jede Kachel an der Wand bringt einen Siegpunkt und Zusatzpunkte für orthogonal angrenzende Reihen, ein fünfter Stein in Reihe oder Spalte bringt daher immer fünf Siegpunkte.

Der besondere Reiz ergibt sich aus dem Erwerb der Steine. Je nach Spielerzahl fabrizieren fünf bis neun Keramik-Manufakturen Angebote und zwar stets vier zufällig gezogene Fliesen. Wer sich bei einer Manufaktur bedient, muss alle Steine einer Sorte nehmen und die in eine Musterreihe seiner Auslage legen. Alle restlichen Steine kommen in ein zentrales Angebot, aus dem sich die Spieler analog der Manufakturregel bedienen.

Abhängig vom Angebot muss daher die Füllung der Musterreihen gut überlegt sein. Dabei bleibt die Wertung im Blick, damit man möglichst nicht Kacheln isoliert anbringen muss. Andererseits müssen die Fliesenleger im Laufe des Spiels aufpassen, da die Aufnahme aus dem zentralem Angebot nicht immer mit den freien Plätzen der Musterreihen korreliert. Nicht unterzubringende Kacheln verhageln die Bilanz und bringen Minuspunkte.

Das Spielende tritt recht schnell ein. Frühestens nach fünf Runden, wenn ein Spieler eine horizontale Linie durchgängig mit Fliesen kacheln konnte. Wer auf mehr Punkte aus ist, achtet aber eher auf Vollendungen der Spalten, denn diese bringen neben der normalen Bepunktung sieben Zusatzpunkte gegenüber zwei Punkten in der Reihe. Wer es schafft, alle fünf Kacheln einer Sorte zu setzen, der bekommt sogar zehn Punkte zusätzlich.

Optisch ein Traum, haptisch ein Vergnügen und vom Spielablauf durchgehend spannend: AZUL hat alles, was ein herausragendes Familienspiel ausmacht!

Tema 248: Let's tile a bathroom...not!
Pregunta:
With three versions of the game now in print, (Summer Pavilion, Stained Glass of Sintra and the basic version, of which I will be talking about) the sky seems to be the limit for Next Move Games. All three games are abstract tile placement games, share the delightful tactile feel and have had some generus buzz built around them. Winning an award or 10 in the progress, like the 2018 Spiel des Jahres and the As d'Or. Having never played the to newer versions, I cannot give you a comparison or rank the titles in any shape or means at this time. Maybe in the future this will come to pass.




Two to four players will have the privilege of collecting these delightful otherworldly tiles and try to apply them on their wall. Of course this sounds very simple, but there are ways and means of collecting and attaching them to your wall, that will add a challenge. Each player will have their own plateau to place their tiles on and score their own points. While in the middle of the table, tiles will be randomly placed on a number of beer coasters, (there is no other way of saying it) to squabble over. This is technically the heart of the fun, or discomfort of the game. Planning ahead and calculating what the other players will take or discard will take up a vast amount of your gaming experience. And the great thing about it is you can still play the game haphazardly and probably still fair well by the end of the game. Making it an easy game for any level of experienced gamer. Just like anybody can slip on a pair of socks but weather there a matching pair all the correct way round doesn't really matter.



So let's go back to the beer coasters. When your turn comes around, you can select one of these beer coasters and remove the tiles from it. From those removed, you can only keep one set of the same pattern. As seen as there are only 5 different patterns (or colour) in the game, you're more than likely keep one or two of the four tiles that are placed there. All of the remaining tiles will be removed to the centre of the table. The centre of the table is treated like one giant coaster. At some stage in the game, a player may decide to collect all of the tiles of one pattern from this space. As the game goes on, more and more tiles will be added to this. First player to do so will have the benefit it of being the first player in the next round. Of course it has an advantage but it also has a disadvantage explain later on. Taking from this pool can have some benefits of its own, as you can grab a greater number of same coloured tiles in one action. Totally beneficial. Also someone could leave you with no choice but to pick up large group of same coloured tiles to add to your board, which could lead to your downfall. This is one of the great dilemmas of the game. Calculating what you need and guesstimating what the others will need. Picking and choosing while forcing the other players to leave you the best scraps. This is not evident in the first and possibly second round, but as the game goes on, you will find and that this is all you're doing.



Let's go back to the tiles that you have decided to keep. These will go to your individual player board, where you have a 5 by 5 gridded wall to try and decorate. But before you can add these tiles to your wall, they will have to be placed off to the side of a column that you wish to add them to. As soon as all of the tiles from the coasters and the middle of the table have been collected, this is when they can be applied to your wall. But only if you have the correct amount for the column. Each column requires a different number of same coloured tiles before they can be added to your wall. One column requires one tile. Another two tiles, three tiles, four and then five. It is only now that they can be added to the wall and you will score points for each that does. Again restrictions are in place to make the game a thoughtful, challenging and hopefully fun experience. Each pattern can only be attached to the wall all in a column that doesn't already have the same pattern. Think sudoku. Not only are you trying to get the correct colours in the correct column, but also so in the right quantities. If you do not have the prerequisite to move a tile onto your wall, the tiles you've collected it was stay in that saved space until you do have the required amount. This can lead to missed opportunities in scoring. And the hope of getting them fulfilled the next round. Observant players may take a gander at your previous rounds treasures and play it to their advantage, as I stated before, taking the things you need leaving the tiles you don’t need to collect in you negative point box...



Moving onto scoring, there are multiple ways to get points from this game. These are all relatively simple, but the strategy relies on how and which spaces on the wall you fill. Placing a tile on the wall will give you a point. Adding a title to an adjacent tile will give you a number of points depending on the number of adjacent tiles, either horizontally or vertically. So as you can see, placing a tile in the right column at the right moment can give you big numbers. This is the strategy that will separate the mice from the men. But it relies on what tiles come out of the bag and onto the coasters, what tiles the other players leave for you to take and which columns you place these tiles into. To win every time you'll need to be a clairvoyant. Or just aware of the scoring strategy. Two things I haven't told you about the scoring are 1) there is a bonus chance to get extra points at the end of the game and 2) you can lose points by taking the wrong pattern or number of tiles.



The bonuses are very simple. You get extra points for each column horizontal or vertical. On top of that, if you manage to add 5 of the same coloured tiles to your wall, they score you mega points as well. But the gut-wrenching part of the game is losing points from round to round. How does this occur? Going back to the very beginning, when you collect tiles from a coaster or the middle of the table, your add them to one column next to your wall. These all need to be of the same colour. And the correct amount needed for the column. If you have more than you need, they cannot be added to another column. If you have no space in a column or it cannot be added to a column due to the fact that you already have that colour attached to your wall in that row, these count towards negative points. At the bottom of your bored there is the negative point boxes. You will add these unused tiles to this one by one, from left to right. And even the first player marker, which is a tile, will go there as well (see, being first player has benefits and negative effects). When a scoring round comes along, this is when you total up every negative point that every negative tile gives you. If you miss plan or have other superior players screwing you over, this can really sting, as each box gets a little more negative. One time that this happened to me, made me hate the game immediately. If I had reviewed the game then and had been a vain critic, my rating would have been very poor. But that's not the kind of critic that I am. Everything deserves more than one chance and not be judged by its cover. Plus this is it go-to game for my wife, hence I have no choice but to play. LOL



Even if you're not enjoying the game, they never tend to last very long. Normally after five rounds the game or come to a close. As the finishing condition is when one player or more has as five tiles in a horizontal line. This is very easy to achieve as the first column only requires one tile of one colour. As long as someone one fills this column each round, round six never exists. It is then that you look at your final scores to decide who the winner is. With relatively simple rules to follow and a rapid playing time, this is a perfect family weight game in a family sized box. Play loose or play it with profound concentration, the choice is yours.



Chunkiness is the key. The boards are thick and sturdy. The tiles are gloriously smooth. And the sack is not bad too. Although I'm not a fan of the black cube, which you place on your board to keep your score. This sucker will slide around from time to time, with so much movement having to move and removing tiles from your board, the board with shuffle or the cube will get knocked. All very minor when you consider the rest of the presentation. Presentation is at its best in the accompanying Rulebook. Well written and well presented with plenty of examples. There is even a variation to the game. By simply flipping your player board over, you will go from a wall that tells you where to put a particular tile, to a wall where you have to decide where to put a particular tile. Still following those Sudoku rules.



Technical Score 9.5/10
The game is brimming with wonderful tactile components, although it a little dull to look at. Simple rule set and quick dplaying time makes for a good family game.

My BGG Score 6/10
(ok -will play if in the mood)
I will hand it to Azul, that it is a very interesting game. But it feels restrictive and repetitive. You have to learn how to be good at it, with a little card counting, bluffing and of course luck. You could say the same about Carcassonne, but there's something enduring and pleasurable about building a map in my opinion.

Combined score 7.75/10

Azul - Review
Play

Respuesta 1:
Good review!

I must confess I fail to see the comparison with Carcassonne. In Carcassonne, if you draw four or five useless tiles in a row (which seems to always happen when I play), you will lose.

It is impossible to get a bad "draw" in Azul. Everyone sees what is available to play at all times. Each turn you have absolute control over what to take from what is left. You can execute a strategy without worrying about never drawing that road/cloister/city section that you need.

I never won Carcassonne and will never play it again. Whereas I've played over 100 games of Azul and will play it again and again and again.

The link to Carcassonne I'm referring to is the luck of what is drawn (and put out on coasters in Azul), card (tile) counting and of course... it's a tile game.

I disagree that with each turn you have absolute control. At the beginning, yes. But nearing round 4 and 5, if the drawn tiles are not what you need and other players are devious, you can end up having half your turns taking one tile, when you'd rather take three. Or taking things that you don't need, just to stop getting negative point. Which then screw you over in the next round. If this is not happening to you, you are that devious player. Congratulations.

And what has winning got to do with anything?

Thanks for the review just bought it and only had one 2 player game but it is awesome! Strategic and layered with decisions and it didn’t take long before we were messing with each other but it didn’t matter cause it was fun and all you do is adjust your strategy anyway. Central area and variable turn order are both a stroke of genius in the game’s design. Can’t wait to play a few more and do my own review!



Tema 249: Finely crafted strategy and satisfying interactions
Pregunta:
At the end of my review of Wingspan, I mentioned that I'd rather play Azul. Discussion under that post helped me clarify what, in particular, I prefer. Both games play primarily on individual player's game boards and look fantastic, but beyond that they diverge considerably in instructive ways.

Whether you prefer ornithology to Portuguese tile is really the only way to separate these games as aesthetic objects. Just as the bird cards in Wingspan resemble historical bird illustrations, Azul's resin tiles look very much like azulejos from Lisbon. It is a shame, however, that two "patterns" are simply blue and red. This can be rectified by purchasing "collector's tiles" from Next Move Games. I'm not sure how I feel about that except that it does no harm to the game unless you can't tell the tiles apart without a distinct pattern.

I won't go into the score or tile-laying rules except to say that they are surprisingly deep and you almost always need a precise number of a particular tile to score without losing points to "broken" tiles. (The more excess tiles you fail to place, the more points you lose per tile.) What makes Azul exceptional is the tile drafting system.

Each round begins with a number of display circles scaled to the number of players (5 for 2 players up to 9 for 4). Each display circle is filled with 4 randomly-drawn tiles. Players take turns choosing one color from a display. They must take all the tiles of that color from the display and the other tiles are moved to the center display. Players can also draw all of one color from the center display, but the first player to do so incurs a minor penalty. Once all the tiles are removed from the displays (including the center), the round is over.

As you plan your round, you might expect to draw, say, 2 red tiles from a particular display. But if another player takes those tiles first, you might need to take 1 red tile from two displays over two turns, which amounts to an opportunity cost. Or, you might decide to dump the red tiles into the center by picking other colors that help your strategy. Critically, plans can be disrupted by players who have no interest in the color you want since they might dump your color into the center with more tiles than you need. Or you might get a windfall as another player unexpectedly gives you just the right number of a pattern by taking other tiles you don't care about this round.

It's harder to explain than to experience, but the drafting system means every other player is doing something potentially interesting (to you) on their turn. Once one person draws their tiles, the rest of the table can draft tiles as they set them down on their tableau. As a result, there's no real downtime as long as people are quick about planning. Even if someone else takes longer to plan, there are always moves and strategies to consider for yourself since the only randomness occurs during the round setup.

Compare that to Wingspan where both birds and food are drafted from a common pool. But unlike drafting in Azul, the Wingspan design blunts the effects of other players by adding mitigating mechanics. Instead of being stuck with just one unwanted choice of food, players can reroll to get a new set of choices. Or you can convert two food tokens into any one food of your choice. Or you can aquire a bird power that lets you convert food. Or you can just do something else and wait for the right food die to come up.

The bird pool has different mechanics, but similar mitigations. If you know what bird power you want and if that power turns up among the three visible cards, other people can mess up your strategy there. But that's somewhat rare compared to the way other people drafting Azul tiles impacts your plans just about every turn. It's the difference between feeling like you are playing with other players and feeling like other players occasionally impact your game.

Azul isn't perfect. Since all the information is open to players at the start of each round, there's a possibility of decision paralysis. Depending on your temperament, the opportunity to screw over other players could be a negative. Wingspan works pretty hard to avoid overt negative interactions. The cost is these can sometimes be underwhelming. Nearly everything in Azul changes the game in meaningful ways, so it can also be more confrontational.

With my children, who don't yet have the skill to be competitive, I've stopped worrying about keeping score. It's not as if I take particular pleasure in beating them anyway. Instead we work to build our walls, which is perfectly satisfying. Alternatively, it works to score people who want to compete and not score those who don't. I suppose this works for any scoring game, but I only just discovered the technique with Azul.

I like that Wingspan sets random bonus goals so that each game is different. I like even better that Azul has goals that are carefully balanced. Lucking into extra points because you happened to have cards that work for the preset goals feels less rewarding than achieving a bonus that you know from prior experience is difficult to do.

Azul simply has the opposite philosophy when it comes to design. I wouldn't exactly call it minimalist since the game feels rich with possibility. But I would say it's weighty where Wingspan feels flighty. Perhaps it comes down to a difference in preference of theme after all.

A copy of this review has been posted on my blog.

Respuesta 1:
I mostly agree with your analysis. Another point is that Azul is much faster paced which gives more opportunities to learn and experiment. Yesterday we had some friends at home, and we went through our games to decide what to play. I picked Azul, wingspan and cosmic encounters. Of the three, we played Azul and CE... Wingspan sat there, very nice but untouched. Azul is ideal for a quiet gaming night with not-hardcore-gamer friends.

Whatever it scores during play.

End Game +2 Points.

All must be placed in one row, the remainder on your floor line.

How do we score OXXOX - two points or just one because the tiles are not one by another?
You would score 1 point when the first tile is placed and 1 point when the second tile is placed for a total of 2 points, assuming neither tile was adjacent to a tile above or below it.

Quote:
Last counting - OOOOO - is this 5 points and after all counting we add +2 points for a complete row?
This would depend on the order you placed them during play.

For example:

0XXXX (1 point)

+
OOXXX (2 points for a total of 3)

+
OOOXX (3 point for a total of 6)

+
OOOOX (4 points for a total of 10)

+
OOOOO (5 points for a total of 15)

versus

OXXXX (1 point)

+
OXXXO (1 point for a total of 2)

+
OXOXO (1 point for a total of 3)

+
OOOXO (3 points for a total of 6)

+
OOOOO (5 points for a total of 11)

Again, this is assuming you don't have any tile adjacent above or below these. You would score an endgame bonus of +2 in both cases for a complete row.


Quote:

No.

I can't be sure, but from your questions it seems like you might not realize that you score each tile individually as soon as it gets placed.

Respuesta 3:
I get it! Thank you!!

@Lilly510

Two quotes from the rules express the concept of a single line only (note the Bold as published).


Then, add the tiles you picked to one of the 5 pattern lines on your player board …



Once all spaces of a pattern line are filled, that line is considered complete. If you have picked up more tiles than you can place in your chosen pattern line, you must place the excess tiles in the floor line.

Would not this Rob the game and the players of the pleasure of choosing which tiles to take based on the overall situation? I think that Azul is much more interesting and rich because of that dynamics. If one would only look at his own board it would be a loss for everyone.

In short, no. A key part of the game is making decisions based on how it might help or hurt your opponents. The boards are not a secret. The absence of a clear rule doesn't mean that you're generally allowed.

Also IMO it's poor sportsmanship. If I played with someone who consistently wanted to do that, I wouldn't play with them much longer.

Not to put too fine a point on it, but that allows a player to straight up cheat, either accidentally or intentionally, since you can't ensure they're following placement rules. So, no.

Respuesta 5:
My opinion is that when the rules don't say "[you may] keep this information secret" that info is public information. So, I wouldn't do it.

The other arguments are very good, indeed.

Technically, I'd agree with all the others here who say, no, you shouldn't be hiding your board. But on the flip side, if it makes the game more fun for you and your game partner/friends, then house rule it and get some screens. My in-laws hate games where there is even a smidge of 'take that' interactions. We still think they'd like Azul, but with screens to block each other's boards to limit the amount of "I'm taking these tiles just so you can't have them."



Tema 252: Score 10 point or 4 point?
Pregunta:
I am new to Azul, and have a question.
In first round my wife had the 4 first rows filled out, giving her 4 placement in a column like this:

XXXXO -> XOXXX
XXXOO -> XOXXX
XXOOO -> XOXXX
XOOOO -> XOXXX

O=a tile, X=nothing

Does she gets 1 point for 1. row + 2 point for 2. row (as there is already one tile above) + 3 point for 3. row (as there is 2 tiles above on the score area) + 4 point for 4. rows (as there is three tiles above) - scoring 1+2+3+4 = 10 point ?
Or does she only score 4 point, one for each row?

Respuesta 1:
10.

Respuesta 2:
Place a tile and score it.

Each tile is placed (topmost then working down) and scored immediately based on its position on your board regardless of any past or future tile placement.

Tema 253: Simpler scoring

The scoring would be simpler if only the adjoining tiles counted for anything:

*o would score 2 instead of 4
o

*oo would score 3 instead of 5

and so on.

Since the conditions for scoring are exactly the same I don't see how this variant scoring model would be simpler... Different, yes but simpler...?

Respuesta 4:
The highest score for a placing a piece is 10. What could be simpler than counting up to 10?

Respuesta 5:
Scoring would be even simpler if you just got a point every time you place one tile.

But that’s not the game.

Respuesta 6:
Early in the game, it would reduce the penalty row’s impact.

As the scoring would be lower, and as you can’t go below zero on the scoring track, you would more often run into a situation where you are protected from losing all of the points your penalties demand.

In addition, as scoring in game is lower, end game scoring for rows, columns, and sets would constitute a larger percentage of the final score.

Respuesta 7:
I don't think this is simpler. You place a tile and now have to ignore it. You still have to count tiles not touching it.

So now instead of counting tiles because they are connected in a row, you count ones connected to the placed tile in a row but skip the placed one, and again in columns. This seems like more work.

Considering your examples...*00 scores 2 points. So did

*0
0

But it arguably requires more foresight to do the second example and thus should earn more points imo

Respuesta 8:
I don't know. It seems like you'd rather not have to remember that a single tile scores one point horizontally and zero points vertically. So, from that perspective it would be simpler and if that floats your boat then go for it. I myself see no reason to change the scoring.



Tema 254: Azul review by TheRatHole.ca
Pregunta:
This review first appeared at TheRatHole.ca/azul

----------------------

This year was the first time in at least 5 years that I wasn’t either a staff member or a volunteer at Animethon. My budget was tight, so I limited myself to just a gaming pass. The Tabletop Cafe once again sponsored the board game tables, and on Friday I got the opportunity to try another game from my board game bucket list: Azul, by Next Move Games/Plan B. The game, designed by Michael Kiesling with art by Chris Quilliams, is a very beautiful game, based on a simple, but intriguing concept. There is also a second version of the game Azul: The Stained Glass of Sintra, but this review will concentrate on the first, tile themed game.

The name, Azul, comes from the Portuguese word azulejos, which describes painted tiles used to decorate walls. The story behind the game is that, after a voyage to Spain, the King of Portugal fell in love with the idea of decorative tiles and decided to have his entire palace redone in azulejos. In the basic version, the player’s job, as a royal tile-layer, is to procure tiles from the factory and create a wall with a specific pattern. In the advanced rules version, players can choose their own pattern.

As I said before, Azul is a physically beautiful game, with 100 plastic tiles in 5 different types that suggest the art of ceramic tile while still being durable. There are also 4 playing boards, one for each player, 9 small boards used as “factory displays”, and 4 small wooden cubes used to mark your place on the scoring track. Rounding out the content of the box is a cloth bag to hold the tiles and detailed instruction manuals in both English and French. (At least in the Canadian version there are French rules.)

The instructions are clearly written, but they contain a lot of detail. I would recommend reading thoroughly before jumping in, because there were a few rules that I missed right away, noticing them later when I was consulting the manual for something else. Luckily none of my errors were serious enough to restart the game. We just adjusted as we went along.

The game consists of multiple rounds, each divided into two stages. In the first stage, your goal is to acquire tiles, either from the “factory displays” or from “general sales”. This is done by a drafting method. Before the game, you set up the tiles, putting four random tiles on each factory display board. The number of factory displays depends on the number of players. The “player who most recently traveled to Portugal” goes first (in our case it went to someone who had been to France). They choose a factory display, but not all the tiles, only the ones that are one colour. The rest of the tiles go to the center of the table as “general sales”. After the first turn, players can pick from the factory displays or the general sales pile. But the first person who takes from the general sales pile has to take the “first player” tile and place it on the “floor” row at the bottom of the playing board. The tiles in this row will score negative points later.

There are specific rules about how you place the tiles you have acquired. On the left side of the board are 5 pattern lines. The first line only holds one tile, the next two, etc until the last row holds 5 tiles. Once you place a tile in a certain row, you can only use the same colour in that row. The goal is to complete as many rows as possible, because only complete rows can be used to tile your “wall” in the second phase of play. After the first round, there is an additional rule that you cannot place a tile in a row if a tile of that colour is on the wall row beside that pattern row. That means the longer you play, the more limits there are on tile placement. Players take turns choosing tiles until every tile has been taken, even if that means “dropping” tiles on the floor that don’t work with your pattern rows.

The second phase of each round involves using your pattern rows to tile your wall. Your wall is on the right side of the playing board, with 5 rows across from the pattern rows. Again, there are very specific rules as to how the tiles are moved. Starting with the first complete pattern row, take the tile on the far right of the row and transfer it to the same row on the wall, marching the printed pattern on the wall. Tiles are scored as soon as you place them, based on whether there are other tiles around it. If a tile is alone, it scores only one point. If the newly placed tile has other tiles above, below or beside it, you count the number of tiles in a row (in both directions) as your score. Diagonal doesn’t count. You continue, row by row, skipping any pattern row that isn’t full.

When you have placed every tile you can you clean up your pattern rows. For every row that you have taken tiles from, you remove any remaining tiles and store them in the game lid (not the tile bag). The tiles in the incomplete rows stay were they are. Next, you score the tiles on the floor. These are “dropped tiles” and score negative points. For each tile on the floor row, you lose the point value of that space. Tiles on the floor also go back in the box, except the first player tile, which goes in front of you (meaning you are the first player of the next round). After all tiles are scored, the factory displays are refilled, and the next round begins. If the tile bag is empty, refill it from the used tiles in the box.

The game ends at the end of the round in which at least one player completes a horizontal row. After scoring all your tile points, each player scores their end of game bonus points. You get 2 points for each complete horizontal row on your wall; 7 points for each complete vertical row; 10 points for each colour of tile for which you filled all 5 spaces of that colour on your wall. The winner is, of course, the player with the highest final score. In case of a tie, the winner is the player with the most complete horizontal rows on their wall.

This is a fun game, not too easy nor too complex. It would be a good way to spend an evening with friends. And, based on my own experiences, it’s also a good game to take with you to a con (or discover at a con) to meet new friends.

In my experience, the biggest issues will be wrt whether or not the fabric was pre-shrunk and whether or not the dye was colorfast.

It's a nice quality bag, so it seems like it should be OK. If the dye is colorfast, you should be able to machine wash cold and dry flat even if the fabric isn't pre-shrunk (added: but it's cotton, so you'll probably have to iron it pretty much no matter how you wash it). You can check whether the dye is colorfast by dipping a corner or an inside seam in soapy water, rinsing just whatever part you dipped, then seeing if the dye runs.

Even if the dye runs, there are products to minimize that if you want to wash the bag, like those dye magnet sheets or Dawn detergent, which has an ingredient that stabilizes loose dye and keeps crap in the wash water from re-depositing.

TMI, probably, but I work with fabric.

I imagine so, I don’t have a load of laundry to do though. Remind me in a few days and I’ll attempt to wash mine
In my experience, the biggest issues will be wrt whether or not the fabric was pre-shrunk and whether or not the dye was colorfast.

It's a nice quality bag, so it seems like it should be OK. If the dye is colorfast, you should be able to machine wash cold and dry flat even if the fabric isn't pre-shrunk (added: but it's cotton, so you'll probably have to iron it pretty much no matter how you wash it). You can check whether the dye is colorfast by dipping a corner or an inside seam in soapy water, rinsing just whatever part you dipped, then seeing if the dye runs.

Even if the dye runs, there are products to minimize that if you want to wash the bag, like those dye magnet sheets or Dawn detergent, which has an ingredient that stabilizes loose dye and keeps crap in the wash water from re-depositing.

TMI, probably, but I work with fabric.
I understand... so little of that... but nevertheless very helpful advice. I'll see if I can gather the courage to try that corner thing. It is a nice bag that I don't want to ruin, even if it came with brown spots on it.

Respuesta 7:
Yes. The bags from Azul may be washed. I recommend removing the tiles first.

Respuesta 8:
Maybe you went ahead and washed it already, not if not my advice:
1) just hand wash it versus washing machine. Wash in sink with regular laundry detergent but by hand
2) use cold water and add a bit of salt, helps stop the colors from bleeding
3) if you have it, toss in some oxyclean as well.

Let air dry

If it is still stained after all that, contact Plan B, maybe they can send your a replacement if it bothers you. If it doesn't then if course don't worry about it

Tema 256: Do the tiles in the center go into the lid after a round? And round question.
Pregunta:
Do all the tiles in the center where that player one markers is at, do they all go in the lid after the round?

Does everybody keep playing until somebody gets that first player marker out of the middle? Is that when the round is over when all the piles are gone and the player one marker is gone too?

Respuesta 1:
The round is over when *all* the tiles are taken by players, including the ones that ended up in the middle. The middle acts just like another factory tile.

Respuesta 2:
The round ends when all the tiles are taken. None left on the factories any more. None left in the middle. Nothing goes back anywhere .

Edit: ed

Respuesta 3:
Rules state:

This phase ends when the center of the table AND all Factory displays contain no more tiles.Then, continue with the Wall-tiling phase.

There will be no tiles left in the middle or on the factory tiles at the end of the round.

Respuesta 6:
This is part of the crux of the game:

Just like in the factories, you MUST take ALL of one tile, so how long do you leave those tiles that you want in the middle?

Do you take them now while there aren’t quite enough, or do you risk waiting and having to pick up more than five later, the excess of which MUST smash on the floor...

Tema 257: How can you have more than one five tile horizontal line?
Pregunta:
"Gain 2 points for each complete horizontal line of 5 consecutive tiles on your wall."

How is it possible to have more than one? Isn't the first person to get a horizontal five across the winner?

Respuesta 1:
The game doesn't end until the end of that round, so you could complete multiple rows in the same round.

Completing a horizontal row doesn't give you the victory, just some bonus points (and triggers the end).

No. That person simply triggers the end of the game. It continues to the end of the round and is then scored.

It is entirely possible - but highly unlikely - that another person will fill every row in that final round. My mind boggles at the potential score!

Respuesta 3:
Thanks. "Gain 10 points for each color of which you have placed all 5 tiles on your wall." I don't know what it means.

Is it because there is only five of each color, so if you get five reds, regardless of placement, you get the bonus?

Correct- you place all 5 snowflake tiles, for example, you get +10 points.

Respuesta 5:
It sounds like you need to play the game.

Yes, you can only place five tiles of each colour - maximum. it is obvious on the "A" side as there is a predetermined place for each tile. And there are five places for each colour. Blue is the most obvious as it forms a diagonal across the board.

It is less obvious on the "B" side, as the positions are not predetermined, but the rules make it so anyway.

@johnnyLikesGames
"Gain 2 points for each complete horizontal line of 5 consecutive tiles on your wall."

How is it possible to have more than one?
I wondered the same thing my first game. But then I realized I was playing a rule wrong, which messed up everything.

I was playing a round as each player taking tiles, placing them, scoring if they finished any 1 row, and then the factories filling back up. Playing the whole game like this would cause the game to end when at least 1 player finished 1 row that round. (No player could finish more than 1, since they're only committing tiles to 1 row for the whole of the round.)

The rule I missed says:
Rules p. 4
wrote:
This phase [the Factory offer phase] ends when the center of the table AND all Factory displays contain no more tiles.
So what you're supposed to do is to keep going in clockwise order until all the tiles are claimed, THEN everyone does wall-tiling, scoring, and cleanup.



Tema 258: Higher Player count?
Pregunta:
Just curious,

How do you think it would work with more players (not too many, thinking 6)--provided there were more components to accommodate (friend has a 2nd copy):

2 more factories per player

More player board of course

Currently there's 100 tiles (20 of each color) so I'm kind of thinking 5 more of each color per player (so that for 6 players it would be 150 tiles total)--I know tiles aren't taken out for 2-3 player games, but I know from my 4-player games we always get to a round or two where there's not enough tiles for all the factories--this would happen sooner and more often with more players without adding more.

I think the game would be a lot more punishing, since the 'center pot' will likely get a lot bigger forcing people to take a lot more tiles than they can...more often.

Anyone give this a try yet?

Respuesta 1:
If I had two copies of Azul and 6 players I'd play two games of Azul.

Respuesta 4:
It becomes even longer between turns, so there's little connection between the supply when you last played and the supply when it's your next turn.

This means less engagement and less ability to make any plans.

The game becomes even more "multi player solitaire" than usual, I'd suspect.

Respuesta 5:
I agree with the comment above that it would be better to have 2 games going. The game play would be faster and less problematic with 2x3 than with 6 I would think.

You could try out some variants on this idea to make it more of a group activity though.

-You could always compare scores of the winners of each game to have an overall champion.

-You could play a partners game, where you are teamed up with a partner in the other game and you add your scores together when both games are completed.

-At the end of each round of play, you could slide everyone clockwise around the table so that each round is played against different opponents. This would also mean you'd be playing with a new bag every couple of rounds, which would alter the probabilities if you are a tile counter. Could create issues though if one game ends after 5 rounds and the other goes 6. You might have to alter the end game trigger.

-Two games are played, but once either has a horizontal row, both games end in the current round. So you'd have to keep an eye on the other game to time the end game correctly.

Respuesta 6:
my 2 cents on this
so by new years we had a lot of azul playing and after some team games i remembered that i had the sintra game also around. i decided to combine both games and i can tell you it was a lot of fun
the only problem was the tile association but i solved that on the next day:
https://boardgamegeek.com/filepage/195787/azul-board-use-bot...
having more players makes you change strategy:
- always go for the first tile (not always but most of the time)
- the center pot must never be too full (it can always go to you the 10 red tiles)
i can tell you that, with 8 players, it was a chaos, but a truly fun one.
i almost bet that the creators imagined the sintra game to be also used as an expansion (if you are reading this, please make an "official expansion with just a pdf and other bonus stuff).
at the end, it was a hell, but a really good one. if you have both, give them a try. also use the point marker from sintra for everyone, it's easier.
cheers



Tema 259: 100 plays in ten months
Pregunta:
UPDATE: Now 200 plays in 15 months! There has been nothing like it...

This is not a review, just a comment. This is a wildly addictive game.

There are exactly five games I have played more than 100 times, Le Havre, Suburbia, Bruges, Saint Petersburg, and Azul. And the bulk of the Suburbia and Le Havre games have been solo games.

With Azul, I reached 100 plays yesterday, 10 months after I was first introduced to the game. Which is by far my fastest to 100 games.

Most of my Azul play has been 2-player. And we show no signs of stopping.

I find this fascinating.

Respuesta 1:
Have you tried the harder-variant of this game? By accident i have played Azul with rules wrong but it made game much more thrilling and exciting. Easier to block other player.

The rule: You cannot have multiple same color patterns in the left side.

The regular rules of Azul made the placing on the left side way too easy and less exciting.
Looking forward to your thoughts.

Respuesta 2:
The only variant we have tried is using six factories instead of five in a two-player game. This was amusing.

I don't find any aspect of the game too easy, and see no need to increase the difficulty.

Respuesta 3:
Did you also try playing with the reverse/B sides of the player boards? In theory it should offer a lot more strategic depth, but I never see anyone mentioning it.

Respuesta 4:
Only tried the reverse sides once or twice. Didn't much care for it. Azul is not a game that benefits from "strategic depth", I have other games that fill that need.

Respuesta 5:

FWIW I've seen some people say the opposite (i.e. the B side's additional freedom makes it easier and removes some tough choices, so it's less strategic).

(But I personally have no strong opinion since I almost always play the A side and like it fine.)

Well, I'm up to almost 200 plays of Azul now (that post will be coming soon) and find that regular old Azul has more than enough variation to still be fresh. How many permutations of 100 tiles over various factories over various rounds are there? I'm no mathematician but I would say it is a lot. Combine that with the variety of individual choice as to how to play those variations and I don't know how the base game could ever be exhausted.

I like Sagrada but find that it is very constricting in terms of your individual options on any given turn. It certainly is the more "strategic" abstract that I would turn to if I needed that sort of challenge. But given the choice, I'd play Splendor over Sagrada for that sort of depth.

And of course, if I had the time and other players interested, I'd jump right to Macao or Caylus for real strategic depth.

In the interim, there is Azul. And I like it just fine.

Tema 260: ok the definitive how to score .. exactly
Pregunta:
Since i played this with 3 different game groups and only my regular game group scores the same as i do so who is right:

me (and gamegroup)

The tiles are placed and the scoring begins;
1) we go from top to bottom; i place the first full row the rightmost tile to the available spot on the grid. NOW i score. Horizontally vertically blabla (this is the same in every group). After scoring i go to the next full row and place its utmost rightmost tile to the grid and score THIS one.
I repeat until im done


vs

the rest:

The tiles are placed and the scoring begins;

2) we go from top to bottom. One at a time i place each rightmost tile to the grid at the right. AFTER i have placed all of them i start scoring the tiles from top to bottom.

When they first played like this i was a bit dumbstruck, but i just agreed to do it this way since its about the fun anyway. I have the german version so i couldnt clearly explained it nor show them if my method was wrong or good. Also in the dutch version it seems so vague, you really could interpret it both ways. The fact that at least 2 other groups played method 2 proves this imo.

Respuesta 9:
thats not entirely true however,

if a row is full and the right one tile in a row is placed to the right grid, its easy to see which one you placed. After all scoring is complete that you remove all rows(you fill rows from right to left, so a incomplete with left tile standing there is incomplete , incomplete with right tile gone has just been placed)

In the german and dutch translation i can see where the confusion comes in. I guess people are just not that great at making statements which are not vague or dont leave room for interpretation.

I think the person who made the point about having to remember which tile was just placed pointed out that it's only a problem with the first row. For the first row, the only tile is moved. If, after placing everything else you now started scoring, you would have had to remember which tile you moved, as there might be 5 tiles on that first line.

You are right that it's not true for the other rows, but the poster already acknowledged that. Also, in my group, we get rid of the left tiles right away, as there is a fair amount of time to set up for the next round, so as we score, we prep. You wouldn't have to do that, but it's nice that you can since scoring is immediate.

Respuesta 11:
thats a valid point indeed. And a good argument against scoring like i described in option 2

I scored like i described in option 1 anyway in my gamer group, but the last two times i played this with nongamers (who just happened to have the game , but was at my place, again i have the german version), they all scored like option 2 and i was like: " huuuh wait a minute"

Next Move is in the Plan B family as an imprint. The studio has the same staff as all the other imprints.

As for insocnsistent quality, it’s very likely a counterfeit if the weight is off or the edges of the board are rough. We have a high expectation for our products and consider it a hallmark of the imprint.

I just picked up a copy from Target a few days ago (original plastic wrap, pulled from the middle of the shelf) and found the bag, manual, and player boards to be perfectly fine.

The precision of the cuts on the factory discs are iffy; they're all off-center by 2-4mm. (My sister, who is rather fastidious about this kind of thing, actually took one look and immediately said, "How much was this?") There's a fair amount of wear on the surfaces of the glossy blue and red tiles, looking like they were stacked up somewhere and jostled for a while; the print on printed tiles look fine. Some of the orange tiles look like they were removed too quickly from their molds; a few of them have corners that look like the plastic flowed slightly.

Combined with luck on the bad player's side, yes. Any game that includes luck (which Azul does because of the bag draw) can be lost due to luck.

As others have said, it would probably be a very rare occurrence.

Respuesta 5:
Cheers, for your view. I agree. Most decent games should have luck on the... 20% side approximately?

Or luck is proportional to player count for non multi-player solitaire games?

Respuesta 6:
No, because you pool the bad tiles to form a central pool of better tiles.

What's an "'expert'" player? How many wins does it take to be an expert?Is there an official ranking somewhere? Are there Grand Masters?

Please define "bad/random player".
Is it a random player from a pool of players in which there could be another expert?
Is it a player from the same pool that is just likely to make "bad" non-winning plays?
Is it a hypothetical play that makes every play choice at random?

Any of these versions of a bad/random player has a statistical chance of defeating a so-called expert at a game of Azul.

Honestly, i'd say the chances of a random player beating a skilled one in Azul are about the same as a random player beating a skilled oponent in chess.

Tiles drawn are public, so a skilled player can adapt to any draw. Worst would be something like leaving 4 in a 5 row then not drawing that color, and that is minimal impact compared to random play.

In almost any given chess position, there are far more terrible moves than good moves. If you have enough chess knowledge to eliminate some of the terrible moves, then you have a better chance to find a good move. So I don't really get your thesis that playing completely randomly is better than playing with some knowledge that eliminates really dumb moves.



Tema 267: Is it a wall or a bathroom floor? All I know is that you need this in your collection. - 3idolon's Game Reviews #15
Pregunta:
I started going in on this hobby fairly recently, so when I got to play Azul I was very much wowed by the scoring mechanic. It made me so awestruck that I can't stopped talking about it with my girlfriend, which pretty much forced her to buy me a copy on Christmas day(yay!)

I don't really have much more to say with the plethora of positive reviews and awards this game has been showered with since its release, but maybe you want another opinion, and that opinion is do I really need this? And to that I will say, if you're starting your collection then yes, you definitely should.

---How-to-Play---

Azul is played by laying out a number of factories depending on the number of players, and placing four random tiles on each of them. In turn players will choose a factory and pick 1 tile design from that factory, then take all the tiles of the same design to place on their board. All the unpicked tiles will be placed in the center pile, where they can also choose tiles from if there are any. The first player to pick a tile from the center becomes the first player on the next round but will incur a small penalty on their score.

The board has five sections that the players can place their tiles in, and each require a set amount of tiles(from 1 to 5) to be processed at the end of a round(which is when all the tiles drawn out from the bag have been taken by the players). Once they've chosen a section they must place all tiles they picked on that section, and if there are excess tiles they will be placed on the penalty row, where they will get deductions at the end of the round.

Once the round ends they proceed with processing, where they will now score their tiles by placing them on the scoreboard(or wall, as called by the game). The players must move one tile on the same row from the ones they placed earlier on their board to the wall and discard the rest to the game box. They will score by counting how many consecutive tiles are formed horizontally and vertically when they place their tile. If there are no tiles beside the ones they placed, they simply score 1 point.

When the next round begins, draw tiles from the bag to fill the factories once more. If there are not enough tiles in the bag, return the tiles discarded to the game box back in the bag. This ensures all tiles go into rotation when playing.

The endgame will be triggered when a player completes a horizontal set of tiles on their wall. The players will finish the round if there are still tiles left to choose from, then they perform one final scoring. Afterwards they will check if they meet any of the bonuses to add to their score, namely, completing a horizontal row(+2), a vertical column(+7), and placing all 5 tiles of the same pattern on your wall(+10). The player with the most points is the winner.

---

The game is a really good gateway game because it will teach players many things that will help them later on when they play other games, the best being that sometimes sacrifices have to be made in exchange of better rewards, and that sometimes you won't see the game ending sooner if you're not paying enough attention to what others are doing. Also, planning is very, very crucial in this game, and that level of planning actually helps when you get to play games which requires heavier decision-making.

Luck plays a factor while playing but not big enough to make the game overly imbalanced, which gives the players the feeling, but not the effect. It's like watching someone pick up a dollar on the ground, you feel cheated in a way, like they took the money from you, but in reality you just wanted it for yourself. Sometimes players, especially the first player, gets a good set of tiles, and you feel cheated, but then again, maybe if you're the first player you won't feel that way.

There is also an undeniable level of satisfaction in filling up the wall. You get a very satisfactory tactile interaction with the pieces, and in the end you get a nice pattern that you made yourself. It's rewarding not just by scoring well, but also by knowing you made those decisions that led you to earning them. It is a very good puzzle game even if you're not into puzzle games.

Not only that but the beautiful art production of the game will certainly intrigue people, especially newbies, and pull them into giving it a try. That's enough reason for many to play, and enough reason for you to add this to your collection if you're still undecided. Granted, there are other games that gives a better headturner feel, but nothing like Azul and its tiles.

Tema 268: A Meeple Pusher Review of: Azul
Pregunta:
NOTE: This review was posted long ago, but BGG took it down, so I am having to repost it. My review of Azul originally appeared here: https://www.meeplemountain.com/reviews/azul-review-tile-your...




Originally blue and white, but later produced in many bright and vibrant colors, azulejo tiles have been around for a very long time. The beginning of these functional works of art dates back to the 13th century. Originally Moorish in origin, the art form really caught on once King Manuel I of Portugal visited Spain in 1503. While he was there, he was mesmerized by the beautiful tile covering almost every visible surface. Transfixed and inspired, he commissioned the production of Portuguese azulejo upon his return.

In the game of Azul, you are taking on the role of one of the commissioned artists. Your goal is to construct the best display (i.e. – score the most points) by the game’s end to please the king. After all, a king’s favor is worth its weight in gold.


Overview

During each round of Azul, players will be taking turns drafting tiles from several collections of tiles in the center of the table. The tiles that a player selects has a direct effect on the pool of tiles that are left for other players to choose from. After taking all of the tiles of the same color from one of the pools, the player will place those tiles onto the “pattern lines” area of their player mat according to specific placement rules. Once all of the tiles have been drafted, any completed pattern lines will cause tiles to be added to the “wall” area of the player mat and score points. The game plays on like this until one player finishes a horizontal line of tiles on their wall. Then, final scoring is performed and the person with the most points wins the game.

If you’re just interested in what I think about the game, feel free to scroll down to the Thoughts section of this review. However, if you’d like to know more about how the game is played, read on.

Setup

First, each player takes a playing mat and places it in front of them with their scoring cube on the 0. Then, a number of “Factory displays” (determined by player count) are arranged in the center of the table in a circle. These Factory displays are then seeded with 4 tiles apiece, drawn from the bag.

A starting player is chosen and they receive the starting player token. Now you’re ready to play.

The Draft and the Pattern Line

At the heart of Azul is the tile draft that occurs each round. Before players take their turns, the starting player token is placed into the area in the center of the floor displays and the starting player seeds the factory displays with tiles. On a player’s turn, they will select a group of tiles from any of the factory displays, take all of the tiles of the same pattern or color, and place them onto their player board into the pattern line area. Any unchosen tiles are moved to the center area between the factory displays. Alternatively, a player may opt to take all of the tiles of the same color or pattern from the center area but, if the starting player token is there, they must take that as well and immediately add it to the “floor line” area of their player board (more on that later).

Placing tiles onto the pattern line requires the players to follow some basic rules:

1. All of the tiles on a single pattern line must be of the same type.
2. A player may not place tiles onto a pattern line if the Wall row corresponding to that pattern line already contains a tile of that color or pattern.

End of Round Scoring

Once every tile has been drafted from the display (with any tiles that the players cannot use being placed into their floor line), each pattern line is considered from top to bottom. For every completed pattern line, the rightmost tile is moved from the pattern line to its corresponding wall location. The tiles left behind on a completed pattern line are removed from the player board and placed back into the box for the time being.

Each tile placed onto a wall is scored both vertically and horizontally. The tile by itself is worth a single point. However, if that tile completes a line of tiles, it scores for every tile in that line.

Once all of the players have completed their scoring, any tiles in their floor lines are placed back into the box. The player with the starting player token places it back into the center area and then refills the factory displays from the bag. If the bag should run out of tiles, the bag is replenished with the tiles from the box.

Endgame Scoring

The game continues on in this fashion until the end of the round in which at least one player has completed a single Wall line. Then final scoring is performed. Players earn bonus points for completed Wall lines, vertical rows, and collecting all 5 of one color or pattern. When the final tally is complete, the player with the most points is declared the winner.

Thoughts

For me, the initial draw to Azul is the stellar artwork and the gorgeous components. I imagine this is true for many people that have played the game. The colors are bold and vibrant and the tiles have a nice chunky, tactility to them. It’s just a very eye-catching game. Looking at it, I can totally understand King Manuel I’s obsession. Chris Quilliams and everyone else involved in the visual aesthetic of this game should be commended.

When I first saw Azul being set up on a table, I sat down to play knowing nothing about the game aside from its popularity. I honestly didn’t know what to expect. As the rules were explained to me, I found them fairly easy to grasp and I was eager to begin playing once the rules explanation was completed.

That first play through did not go very well. By the end of the fifth or sixth round, I had only managed to earn a pitiful 17 points. In the very next round, I got stuck with a massive pile of red tiles that all went to my floor area. In one fell swoop, almost all of my progress was erased. I was so incensed that I rage quit. I was ready to throw Azul into a fire and never revisit it again.

Thankfully, cooler heads prevailed. My wife convinced me to come back and revisit the game. I’m glad I did because my terrible first game experience taught me lessons I hadn’t realized that I was learning. To rehash a trite expression – it was like a light bulb went off in my head. I was suddenly able to peer around the mechanics of the game and see the clever strategy that lay behind it. I went from being Azul’s number one detractor to one of its biggest fans.

Playing Azul is a lot like playing a game of chess. You’ve always got to be aware of what your opponent is doing. Sometimes it’s very obvious, sometimes it’s less so. If you can clearly see that their completing a single pattern line is going to give them a ton of points, then your strategy should change accordingly. Maybe you want to try to load up the center with as many tiles of that color as possible so that they are forced to take way more than they need. Or maybe you decide to try to pick up all of those tiles for yourself. If you go that route, though, you’re going to want to try to maximize your point scoring opportunities in accordance. It’s a clever game of cat and mouse as you try to maneuver your opponents into unwanted positions while trying to force them to open up good scoring opportunities for you at the same time.

This is where the heart of Azul lies – this constant guessing and second guessing (and even triple and quadruple guessing!) as you try to puzzle out how your opponents are liable to react to your actions. “If I take those tiles, then they’ll probably go for those over there which will leave THOSE other tiles in the center and then I can grab those on my next turn and complete this pattern line over here. But, if they don’t go for those other tiles, they might go for that bunch instead. Maybe I should go for that other bunch, even though it doesn’t really help me much, to try to force them into going for the tiles that I really want them to go for. But, wait…” And on and on it goes. While these kinds of mental gymnastics might not be appealing to some, for me they are what really makes this game great. Constantly having to make interesting decisions even helps me overlook the randomness introduced by the tile drawing. I almost don’t even notice it anymore. I’m all about that brain burning.

It’s no wonder that this amazing game received a Spiel des Jahres nomination. Azul’s made a believer out of me and I can’t get enough of it. In the few short months that I have owned it, it’s become my second most often played game. The easy to learn rules, the super quick set up and tear down, and thought-provoking game play keep me coming back for more. Add in the fact that a typical games of Azul only lasts 20-30 minutes and you’ve got a recipe for an almost perfect game. If you’ve never played Azul or you’re on the fence about it, I highly recommend you give it a try.

Tema 271: Azul - To Dice For Reviews
Pregunta:
Designer: Michael Kiesling
Artist: Philippe Guérin, Chris Quilliams
Publisher: Plan B Games (and others)


Elevator pitch


Img: Great art!

Azul is a tile drafting and placement game. In this game, players embody tile workers of the Portuguese late Gothic era (Manuelino) and are decorating a wall that will be evaluated (aka: scored).
At the beginning of the game, several dice pools (with 4 tiles each) are created and, on a players turn, he/she has to draft all the tiles of a single color from one of these pools. All remaining tiles are gathered in the center, creating a new available pool.
The gathered tiles are then placed on a player board, that has 5 "conveyor belt" rows, and a correspondent 5x5 grid. Tiles are placed in the belts, and once it's filled, one of the tiles moves the grid. If a player ever has more tiles than spaces available on a conveyor belt, that player is penalized.
There can only be a tile of a single color in each column or row, and once any player fully completes a row, the game is over.
Players score for completed rows, columns and full sets of colors. The player with the most points is considered the winner.


What makes it fun?

The drafting system is pretty impressive. It instantly brings a ongoing tension to the table. A tension that is influenced by various factors: there's the multiple draft pools calling for your attention; fighting against what you need on your own board; fighting against what you don't want other players to get; and over all this, there's the middle pool of tiles, that can be a blessing or a curse.
I like drafting games quite a lot, and always happy to see new systems created, that keep this mechanism fresh.


What detail blew my mind?


Img: Got to Demo Azul @Ducosim (Netherlands, 2018). Pretty fun experience.

How much mean it gets to be, maybe it didn't blew my mind, but it was definitely a surprise. In most of my plays, I've encountered always a player that her/his only focus was to hate draft basically in all turns.
Before playing this game, I was hearing a lot that "Azul is the next ultimate gateway game!" (or something alike) but I'm not sure a game that can be this mean works as a "all-rounder" gateway. I'm sure it will work on various situations, but I can see it failing in a lot others too.


What I don't like about it?

That previously mentioned drafting system is also what I didn't like about this game. The issues is that you are more incentivise to "hate draft" instead of taking what you need. I don't have mathematical proof of this, it's just a feeling.
What I mean is, between taking the option that clearly is good for you (example:you need 3 blues, then you take 3 blues), what works better is to take the second or third option, making sure you screw the other player(s) (example: take one blue tiles this time, and moving the three orange tiles to the center pool that your opponent needed). Which is fine, I can agree that hate-drafting is part of drafting, however, when I feel that it is not a choice (I either do it, or lose), then it's not fun anymore for me.


How did my friends react to it?

Most of the people that I know that own it or have played Azul, like it. Some even love it. And over that, most of the people that I talk to disagree with my points on the drafting, but they do agree that it can be a mean game.


Is it a keeper?

I never actually owned this game, so the question above doesn't fully apply. It should be more like: Would ever add this game to my collection? And the answer is no, not really. It's a fine game, but not for me.
I love drafting! Absolutely love it. But I now understand that drafting where all information is open are not fun for me. For example, in games like 7 Wonders or Bunny Kingdoms, the drafting works great for me. I can draft what I want or I can hate draft, depending of what I FEEL like is the best on any particular moment. However, it's just that, a feeling, it's very hard to know exactly if it's the correct option (since you only see one hand at a time).
However, in Azul (or 7 Wonders Duel, comes to my mind) you can actually math out the outcomes (not 100%, but close to that), so it's more like calculating moves ahead, instead of gut playing.

On a side note, I played Azul: Stainglass of Sintra a couple of times. And it worked better, a bit, but only because there's more that players can do on their board, so just harder to calcutate. But still, you technically can still do it. Not for me either.

Game overview
You are the one responsible in the tiles factory in Portugal and taking only the best tiles to make your design; every piece as to fit perfect for you to be satisfied. The worst that can happen is you dropping precious tiles on the floor – this will end up costing you a fortune if you are not careful.

Depending on the number of players there are 5-9 factory tiles with each 4 random tiles to pick from; but you can’t just pick anything you want; if you commit yourself to a color, you have to take everything of the color – the rest goes into the middle for a quickly growing pool of tiles. You can pick tiles from the middle with the same principals, but the first to do so gets a penalty but also becomes the first player for the next round.

You will draft tiles based on both what fits you best, even if you in some cases will end up dropping a few tiles on the floor; drafting to give someone else a bunch of negative points, or just taking it from them. It all depends on your gaming style.

Then it‘s the next players turn and you continue in this fashion until all the tiles are gone, even those in the middle. Then it’s time for the round scoring and checking if someone ended the game.

For scoring you look at the rows that are completely filled in the left side of the board and slide the rightmost tile over to the pattern (matching the color if playing on the starter side) and score for this tile. It’s important that you start with the top row and downwards. Rows not completely filled stay for the next round. Points depends on how many tiles the sliding tiles connects both horizontally and vertically; if it’s the only tile it scores just 1 point – making chain reactions is the key to this game.

The game ends when someone fills at least 1 row in the pattern and then the extra end of game scoring is done.

Only when you run out of tiles do you place the leftover tiles in the bag to reseed the factory tiles – this also gives another strategic thinking, as you can’t expect every color to appear in every round.

How is it?
This is a great game, and fairly easy to teach, most find it easier to understand when seeing the game in action as they get a bit confused about the tile placement and sliding and scoring only one tile. This game works great for non gamers as well, but the strategy part about which tiles to take and maybe ruin it for others might take some time for some of them to get into. But that is not saying they will not still enjoy it, it just means if they get too many tiles on the floor every time they might give up.

The game plays quickly, but there might be some thought pauses in there (analysis paralysis). It’s a beautiful games with nice chunky components, and everyone likes to just fiddle with some in their hands. It’s clear to see why this became the Spiel Des Jahres, as everyone should be able to enjoy this game, if you like playing games.

Strategy & complexity
You can play the game in different ways – zen like with just matching colors and the pattern to the completely strategist of planning every move and other’s moves. Somewhere in the middle is the best games for me. The game is easy to grasp for most after playing a round or 2.

Replayability
The replay values is very high, because of the randomness of the tiles and the player interaction. Some times you just get this perfect factory tiles with 4 of the same color and you are the first player – win!

If you need a bit more variability you can use the blank side, which makes you think a bit more about which tiles you take as everything is open. This also means that usually people score a lot on the first round, because you tend to place the tiles next to each other, scoring chains than you can do in the base game.

Expansion 1: Joker tiles
When using these tiles you, depending on player count, remove 1 or 2 of each colors and replace them with these joker tiles. The joker tiles gives you the option to draft all these and an extra color from that factory tile (or middle). When placing the joker tiles maybe together with other colors, the rightmost tile must be a joker and therefore slide over. There are special rules if your row consists of only jokers or a combination. And at the end of the game the joker tiles DO NOT count as any color and will not help you in the end of game scoring.

I have not had the opportunity to test this yet, but this seems to add some more strategic thinking to the game.

Expansion 2: Special Factories Promo
Consists of to modules which can be combined as fit. The first are the 2 special factory tiles; where the tiles left from selecting a color are not moved to the middle but for the 1 factory tile they remain and for the other they are moved to the left and/or right of the players choosing, but no color can be split.

The other module is some double scoring markers, where players can once per game choose to get double points when moving tiles to the wall from the pattern, but only if that double scoring marker for that particular color is still there.

I have not had the opportunity to test this yet, but this seems to add some more strategic thinking to the game, especially that less tiles are going into the middle.

Scalability
I have played it at all player counts multiple times and I enjoy it with all players, but I think I do prefer it with 3 or 4, just because of the extra player interactions; but it also makes it harder to calculate in the beginning who will end up getting too many tiles. With 2 players it’s a bit more intense back and forth and you can’t make small silent alliances like with more players. It also doesn’t seem so crucial to go first in a 2 player game as in a 4 player – a lot of tiles are removed before it’s just turn with 4 players.

I would play it again in a heart beat with any player count

Rules & accessibility
Very clear rules with nice examples; there shouldn’t be anything to be in doubt of, maybe only the variant as it can be interpreted a bit different; but you can also house rule it and play the way you want with this option. The only thing that might confuse people is the scoring for each tile, where the tile sliding over will be counted twice if both in a column and a row, but you will soon get the hang of it.

Solo variant
There is no solo variant in the box, which is always sad, when you really like the game and want to play it even more. There are some unofficial variants online, using a die to determine which factory tile the AI will take tiles from. It doesn’t really excite me, and you might as well just play two-handed with playing the best you can for both players.



Remote playability
Azul works really well with playing via Skype or Google hangouts. The colors are clear and distinct and there are no hidden information. The only thing you need are markers, either colors or number beside each factory tiles for the players to tell you which factory tile they want tiles from. Your only limit of players is your camera and space on the table.

Portability
Azul is quite portable, mostly it’s tiles and a few boards. If you are traveling lightly the weight of the tiles might be an issues and the player boards takes up the most space as they don’t bend.

Appearance & component quality
This is an Eye Pleaser with great colors and inviting components. The tiles are nice and chunky and feels good in the hands, only downside is it looks as candy

The cardboard is nice and thick for the player board and the factory tiles. The first player token in my first print was just a thin little cardboard piece, but they have changed it to a small tile, which I later got, so no complains there anymore.

Only complain is mostly the functionality. You have a little score marker cube which just sits on top of the board. It is really easy to bump against or accidentally moving it. The same goes for the tiles, although they are heavier you can also accidentally move them.

It would have been great with an indented board, and this is why there is now a market with unofficial overlays for the player boards; which I myself have not gotten yet.



Helge’s review
(and Birger)

The box is perfect. It has the right size and it’s a complete square. The quality is nice and it doesn’t hurt it compliments my eyes. I always prefer if I can have all my limbs tight together but still having room to breathe. I love the sound of the tiles banging against each other in the bag or box lid (when I’m not sitting in it of course) and playing with them is fun too. There enough tiles that my human might not easily see that I pushed some away. The quality of the tiles are excellent, and can withstand me playing with them.

Tema 274: Two players and seven factories - a crazy ride
Pregunta:
So my dear gaming friend, thirty or forty games into playing Azul with me 2-player, mostly on the basic side (we have tried the gray side a few times), said to me "what would it be like if we had seven factories instead of five?" So I humoured her and we gave it a try. She got tired of each game ending after five turns and never seeing the tiles again.

Now, seven factories is 28 tiles - and there only are 30 spaces on the combined player boards for two people. So you can see the problem. Any non-normal distribution of tiles and the floor can get very crowded.

The game still ended in five turns, but we did have to refill the bag for turn five. We each scored the maximum 14 points in floor penalties once, and a few other small ones. We ended up tied at 48-48 before endgame, but she had 33 bonus points (three down, two across, five of a colour) to my 30 (two down, three across, five of a colour) and won 81-78. I had only four blank tiles on my board, and she had five.

It was a lot of fun.

But I like the one in your image much better. Yours only goes up to 100, rather than 200. 200 makes the mat too large. 100 looping back to zero for larger scores makes the mat a nice size.

And I much prefer the switchback style with arrows that yours has, rather than the always-left-to-right style of the one I linked to above (as well as other score mats in the Files section that I came across).

It isn't just the accidental knocks. Folk just seem to be prone to making inadvertent mistakes on their boards. So rather than each individual board being closely policed by the group, it's much easier to reconcile a single scoretrack, where your points can be seen and adjusted relative to others'.

Respuesta 17:
FWIW when we play, we observe/"police" when people do their scoring, regardless whether it's on individual score tracks or on a single communal score track.

So to me, the only obvious advantage of a communal score track is that it makes it slightly easier to directly compare players' scores (for strategizing purposes and deciding whom I want to hurt, etc).

(And since I usually play 2-player, this also is not a real problem for me.)

Meanwhile, in an alternate universe in which Azul came with a single communal score track, a dissatisfied player remarks that "folks just seem to be prone to making inadvertent mistakes on a single communal score track":

* accidently moving the wrong player's marker (i.e. brainfarting on which color you are),

* accidentally bumping another player's marker while you move your own

...and neither of these errors can happen on individual score tracks...

The more important complaint for me about Azul's score track is that the spaces are so small, so a slight bump or imprecisely placed marker can make it ambiguous in which cell a marker sits.

Yeap, my group is having the same problem, except flipping up.

My player boards are a bit warped to, nice to spin and play Truth Or Dare, but not Azul, 'cause tiles and score marker can easily move.

And if the player is with big tummy or loose T-shirt, the player's board moves too. So, it seems like this game needs to be extra careful with, which will be "asking too much" from guys (what I noticed from my group).

I don't have these problems with me though, but it'll a bit annoying if my opponents keep messing the tiles/VP token, and put back simply according to their vague memory... I'll feel it's unfair and destroying the fun. (eg: there's a huge difference between 28VP and 48VP)

Does this then change the scoring of the first piece to two points?
No, it does not change the scoring of the first tile. In the "Wall Tiling" part of the rulebook, it says "Go through your pattern lines from top to bottom. Move the rightmost tile of each complete line to the space of the same color in the corresponding line of your wall. Each time you move a tile, score points immediately."

So you score the points when you move the tile and then you're done scoring that tile no matter what else happens during the tiling phase.

Respuesta 2:
Don Aranda
@daranda

No. This is why the scoring is done one tile at a time. Otherwise, you'd have to somehow keep track of which ones were scored this round. That's easy the first round, but gets unreasonable late in the game.

The game does not immediately end when you move the tile that completes a wall/scoring line. Somebody completing a line simply indicates that this is the last scoring round for everybody. Everybody still scores as normal. Once that's done, everybody also scores bonuses for completed rows, completed columns, and all 5 of a color.



Tema 280: AZUL - Reseña por El viernes toca... JUGAR!!
Pregunta:
AZUL - JUEGO DEL AÑO 2018 Y POSIBLE SACACUARTOS??



Azul ha sido nombrado juego del año 2018 en Alemania y no por casualidad, en esta ocasión creo que han escogido un buen juego. Aquí os cuento mi experiencia y reseña del mismo a todo color y porqué pienso que esto es un sacacuartos, una auténtica vergüenza.

Resumen rápido

Azul es un juego abstracto de 2 a 4 jugadores en el que tenemos que ir alicatando una pared de 5 x 5 cuadrículas con azulejos muy vistosos. En cada turno deberemos escoger con cuidado los azulejos de un solo color de unos grupos que se encuentran en el centro de la mesa y colocarlos en una zona "de espera" en nuestro tablero hasta que no queden más fichas en el centro. En ese momento colocaremos los azulejos en nuestra cuadrícula siguiendo unas sencillas normas y puntuaremos esa ronda.

El juego continúa hasta que alguien consigue completar una línea horizontal de azulejos produciéndose una puntuación final adicional.

Un juego sencillo pero a la vez estratégico, donde no solo es importante saber escoger los azulejos que te interesan si no también los que le interesan a los contrarios. Muy vistoso y colorido, con reglas muy sencillas, de duración ni larga ni corta, con cierto pique, pero a mi gusto un poco sobrevalorado.

Ficha BGG: https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/230802/azul

Caja y componentes

Este juego te entra por los ojos, tanto si ves la caja que destaca enormemente en cualquier estantería, como si lo ves en una mesa de juego.

La caja es un poco más pequeña que la de Catán, sobra algo de espacio pero no demasiado. Incluye un inserto con unas ranuras muy bien pensadas para unas fichas circulares de las que luego hablaré.



Los 4 tableros de juego impresos a doble cara (una con un patrón donde colocar las fichas y otro sin patrón); son de un cartón grueso y resistente, de buena calidad y con una simbología muy clara. Solo tendrás que leer las reglas una vez. Para llevar los puntos se incluyen 4 cubitos de madera negros.



También hay 9 piezas circulares de un cartón ya más delgadito que cumplen perfectamente su función, pero ya puestos a pedir podrían haber sido de un material más duro, o incluso plástico, que sería lo suyo... Ya veréis que voy a estar criticando el precio todo el rato ;-)



Bueno, y ahora lo mejor del juego, los azulejos. Son como Sugus, de plástico resistente. Hay 20 de cada uno de los 5 tipos, total 200 fichas. Hubiera sido una pasada que fueran del material de las fichas de dominó o del Hive (que no recuerdo cuál es), pero bueno, están muy pero que muy bien.



El material del juego se completa con una bolsa preciosa de muy buena calidad para guardar las fichas, una pasada total.

Preparación

La preparación es bien sencilla, aunque te exige un poco de espacio...

Cada jugador recibe un tablero de jugador y se decide si jugar por la cara con patrón o sin él (más difícil). Los jugadores colocan su cubo de puntuación en el 0.

A continuación se colocan 5, 7 ó 9 fichas circulares, llamadas expositores y sobre ellas se colocan al azar sacándolas de la bolsa, cuatro losetas en cada una de ellas. Además se coloca la ficha de jugador inicial en el medio.

Así de bonita luce la mesa con todo preparado para 2 jugadores, un espectáculo...



Mecánica

La mecánica es bien sencilla. En el primer turno se elige un jugador inicial y por orden, cada jugador puede hacer lo siguiente:

Fase de elección y preparación de losetas (Oferta de fábrica)

1.- Coger todas las fichas de un color de uno de los expositores y dejar los que sobren en el centro de la mesa.

2.- Coger todas las fichas de un color del centro de la mesa. Si además es el primer jugador que hace esto, se lleva la ficha de jugador inicial y la coloca en la parte inferior de su tablero (línea del suelo), donde esa ficha le restará 1 punto al final de la siguiente fase, la de alicatado.

Las losetas escogidas se deben colocar a la izquierda del patrón del tablero, donde hay 5 líneas llamadas líneas de patrón. La primera tiene 1 espacio, la segunda 2, y así hasta la quinta.



Deberemos colocar las losetas en cualquiera de las líneas respetando unas reglas:

1.- Todas las losetas deben ser del mismo color en una línea



2.- No podemos poner losetas en una línea de un color que ya esté colocado a la derecha, en el patrón; es decir, no podemos repetir color en una linea horizontal



3.- Las losetas que nos sobren irán a la linea del suelo, donde nos penalizarán, tanto más cuantas más fichas tengamos.



La fase de Oferta de fábrica se repite hasta que no haya losetas en ningún expositor ni en el centro de la mesa.

Fase de alicatado

Esta fase tiene dos partes, la de colocación de fichas y la de puntuación

Colocación de fichas:

Iremos comprobando desde la primera línea de patrón hasta la última, cuál está completa.

Si no está completa nos la saltamos y la dejamos como está.



Si tenemos una línea completa, podremos poner un loseta en el patrón en su lugar correspondiente si jugamos con el tablero que tiene el patrón dibujado o en cualquier lugar del patrón libre en el caso del tablero difícil.



En el caso del tablero difícil deberemos tener cuidado de no repetir el mismo color ni horizontal ni verticalmente. De ahí la dificultad, ya que como nos liemos un poco... en fin, será complicado.

Las losetas que sobran de la línea completada se dejan aparte, en la caja, vaciando la línea para futuras losetas.

Puntuación:

Cada vez que colocamos una ficha en el patrón, puntuamos un punto por ella y todas las adyacentes horizontales primero y todas las verticales después.



En este ejemplo, puntuamos al colocar la ficha roja, 5 puntos (3 verticales y 2 horizontales).

Si la ficha está solita y sin compañía, solo recibe 1 punto

Las fichas del suelo restarán puntos, como se comentó antes.



En este ejemplo nos restaríamos 4 puntos.

En este momento se comprueba si alguien ha completado alguna línea horizontal en el patrón. Si no es así, quien tiene la ficha de jugador inicial se convierte en jugador inicial y repone las fichas en los expositores, deja la ficha de jugador inicial en medio de la mesa y comienza una nueva ronda.

Final del juego y puntuación final

Cuando al menos un jugador ha completado una línea horizontal y se han colocado todas las losetas de las líneas de patrón en el patrón, se hace una puntuación adicional.

1.- Cada jugador que tenga una línea horizontal completa, 2 puntos
2.- Cada jugador que tenga una línea vertical completa, 7 puntos
3.- Por cada grupo de 5 fichas del mismo color en el patrón, el jugador se lleva 10 puntos.

Todas estas puntuaciones finales vienen indicadas en el tablero.



El jugador con mayor puntuación gana la partida.

Precio

Bueno, pues me parece un tanto sobrevalorado la verdad. Si bien es cierto que hay 100 fichas de plastiquito precioso han dejado dos de ellas sin dibujo (lo comento más abajo en la opinión).

Aunque se supone que el premio al juego del año no influye en el precio, en este caso creo que es evidente que sí.

Ahora, creo que es un precio que se va a amortizar, así que tú mismo, 40 € te contemplan.

Curva de aprendizaje

La primera partida es de aprendizaje, así que si estás explicando el juego, no abuses, ganas fijo (certificado). También se notan las partidas siguientes. El juego es relativamente sencillo de dominar pero requiere su estrategia.

Variaciones y ampliaciones

Buceando en la BGG y en la web del fabricante, me encuentro que hay una versión de Sintra (lugar que he visitado) y tiene buena pinta. No es una ampliación, más bien parece un juego con la misma mecánica o parecida pero con cristaleras. Ya empezamos a exprimir el bolsillo...



También al parecer hay unas fichas extra Joker que tienen buena pinta...



Y también lo más vergonzoso... fichas más molonas rojas y azules (ahora me explayo en la opinión), no te lo pierdas...

Opinión

Estoy muy indignado con un temita que comento luego, pero primero doy una de cal...

Vaya por delante que me parece un muy buen juego, y allí donde lo he sacado ha gustado. Para ser un juego abstracto, con la temática muy bien pegada, está muy bien. Es en eso en donde los abstractos fallan, en el vestido que se les pone y este vestido es precioso.

La mecánica está muy bien pensada y no tiene fisuras. El juego fluye a la perfección. Lo que probado a 2 y a 3 jugadores y va perfecto, como un reloj.

Un juego familiar perfecto para iniciarse y bastante diferente a todo lo que he jugado, ha sido todo un acierto comprarlo y te recomiendo fuertemente que te hagas con uno.

Eso sí, vuelvo a insistir que está sobrevalorado, quizá si te esperas un poco baje de precio o quizá lo encuentres de segunda mano. Tampoco es tan difícil hacerte uno a medida con fichas del chino, lo único complicado, el tablero, pero en fin...

Y ahora la de arena...

Aquí es donde pongo un grandísimo "PERO". Hay 5 fichas con diferentes colores base.



¿Alguna cosa que comentar?

¿Algo te llama la atención?

¿Solo soy yo el que lo ve?

¡¡SOLO SE HAN CURRADO TRES DE LAS CINCO FICHAS!!

En serio, más de uno igual me trolea, pero es que estoy indignadísmo. Joder ponle unos dibujitos amarillos o blancos, cualquier cosa... Pero claro, después, investigando para hacer esta reseña, me encuentro con esto:



Aaaaaamigo, que nos van a colar fichas chulas a cambio de más pasta. ACOJONANTE.

No sé qué pensarás tú de esto, pero yo estoy que flipo...

Todo el Hype que tenía de este juego se me ha venido abajo y es que no hay derecho a que hagan esto. Las fichas rojas y azules del juego son "bonitas", pero lo suyo es jugar con estas. Lo que digo, un sacacuartos. Por mí se las pueden meter por donde les quepan (y eso que me molan todo). Es una vergüenza que no vengan con el juego.

Bueno, pues aquí lo dejo.

Vuestros comentarios serán bienvenidos, como siempre.

A disfrutar de este Azul y si alguien se compra las fichitas de marras le agradecería algunas fotos.

Tema 281: Azul: A four-sided review

Review originally posted here:

https://goplaylisten.com/games/azul-board-game-a-four-sided-...

---

Azul is an abstract family board game for two to four players. It takes less than an hour to play, works at all player counts and is a doddle to teach. Anyone can play, but there’s also plenty for a serious gamer to get their teeth into. Released in 2017, it won the 2018 Spiel des Jahres (alongside numerous other top awards) and is ranked in the Top 50 games of all time at Board Game Geek. Inside the striking box you’ll find four large (24x24cm) double-sided player boards, nine round beer mat-sized boards, four wooden cubes, 101 thick plastic tiles (one a start player marker) and a cloth bag to put them in.

The colourful art and design are taken from Moorish art and architecture, giving it a unique look. While the board quality is average, the tiles (which look like Bakelite) make the game stand out on the table. The overall production is both tactile and gorgeous, which has helped the Azul board game become one of the biggest releases of recent years. And at less than £30 its good value for money – especially as the tiles seem practically indestructible. But does the game play match up to the design quality?



Teaching

The rulebook barely stretches to five heavily illustrated pages and is simple to teach as that might suggest. Plus, there’s no hidden information, so you can easily walk players through the first rounds giving advice. Setup sees 5/7/9 factory displays (read: beer mats) placed in a circle in the middle of the table, depending on player count. The 100 tiles (20 in each of five colours) are placed in the bag and four randomly placed on each mat. Everyone grabs a player board (they’re identical), and one player the start player marker.

The start player now chooses one of the mats and takes all the tiles of one colour from it, pushing any other tiles that were on it into the middle of the table. They also place the first player marker in the centre of the table with the unwanted tiles (if any). They then place the tiles they chose on their player board. Instead of taking tiles from a mat, you can instead take all tiles of one colour from the middle of the table. The first player to do so also takes the first player marker for the next round. This tile goes into one of your negative score slots (see below), but can definitely be worth doing. You always have to take tiles, and always all available of the colour you choose in the place you take them from.

The player board has five lines to put them in, of 1,2,3,4 & 5 spaces respectively. Each line can only hold tiles of one colour, and all tiles placed in the same turn must go in the same line. If you take three black tiles and only place two in a line, the other one is going to be wasted. You can have more than one row of the same colour – you just can’t place tiles taken in a single turn in different lines. Wasted tiles are where the game comes into its own. More on this later, but for now know your board has seven spaces at the bottom for these wasted tiles. The first couple will lose you one point, the next ones two and the last few three. So, it is possible to lose 14 points in each round of the game.

Once all tiles have been taken, players simultaneously score. Any line you’ve filled is emptied, with one of the tiles moved to your 5×5 grid scoring area. It will immediately score you points, but will also score bonuses at the end if you’ve completed rows, columns or colours. You take off any negative points, then refill the mats and go again. Play continues until, after scoring, a player has completed at least one row (usually five to seven rounds). The player with the most points wins.



The four sides

These are me, plus three fictitious players drawn from observing my friends and their respective quirks and play styles.

The writer: The Azul board game is the poster child for simple yet emergent game play. The fact each colour can only be scored once per line starts to limit you – especially as completing a colour is desirable, as its worth 10 points. But all your options recede as the game goes on, just with harsher penalties connected to bigger/riskier scoring opportunities. You can try and rush the game in five turns (by quickly completing a row), but this is hard to score well. So in a simple game structure there are multiple paths to victory – but none easy to pull off.
The thinker: The reverse of the player board has a blank grid. Each line can still only have one of each colour. But you can choose where they go within that line as you complete them. For me, this opens up your options in how to build your score. But it also limits how much your opponents can easily predict which colour you may go for (they can, but it needs more thought). This extra layer makes an already satisfying game even more so, and in such a simple way. And as it lasts a little over 30 minutes, and sets up/packs down easily, it is a near perfect filler.
The trasher: When I first started playing I thought great, another boring abstract. But as the options shrank and it became clear someone was going to get screwed – boom! The real Azul revealed itself. As rounds progress, you start to see how many turns (so sets of tiles) you’ll have to take. But you can rarely be sure until near the end. It’s then a balancing act of what you need versus what you can possibly take. And equally importantly, what will leave your opponents in the deepest doo-doo. Once you start to understand this, you realise that planning a big score is pointless without weighing the consequences of some big negative points. And then you understand just how clever the game is.
The dabbler: Firstly, this game is beautiful. From the art to the tiles, it’s the perfect package. Next, it’s easy to learn – and with a theme that would very rarely put a non-gamer off. It works as a very quick two-player game or a slightly longer game with more, but never outstays it’s welcome. And finally it generates conversation and banter: you can chat about what to take, revel in each other’s misfortunes, but till congratulate clever moves. It can be a mean game, sure – but it doesn’t feel as if you’re being picked on. so, all round, this is a real winner.



Key observations

You’ve probably guessed which side of this I’m coming down on… but there are some naysayers. One obvious (and understandable) objection is the meanness. Azul isn’t a game you can play co-cooperatively, as it’s built around the tension of being stuck with tiles you don’t want. So, if you really don’t like games with in-built conflict, Azul may not be for you. But it’s good enough I’d still suggest giving it a go.

Other criticisms are similarly viable. Some players don’t like abstract games; others want their conflict to be clearly personal. Others must have a longer, more complex game; or one where you can plan more in advance. Again, to each his own. These are not criticisms – more statements of what a player likes and dislikes. So again, if you fall into these camps, the game may not be for you. As one player said, rating it 2-out-of-10: “I can see why this game is so popular, but it’s not for me.” Fair play to them. But at the time of writing, just over 100 people had rated Azul as a three or less. More than 20,000 have rated it 8 or higher.

Conclusion

As someone who dabbles with game design, it’s releases such as Azul that remind me why I bother. Game design is an oft thankless task. You slave for hours on something you think is worthwhile in the hope it will make at least a splash. Just wanting people to enjoy it, knowing the chances of making any real money are slim to none. You have to think of it as a hobby, even if you hope for more. Then you watch another film tie-in Monopoly sully the shelves of your local ginorm-o-store and think – why bother?

This is why. Because, one day, I may put together a bunch of ideas that 20,000 fellow gamers think is outstanding. That sells enough copies to actually register as a blip on my bank statement. Played by gamers and non-gamers alike. And sure, before you say it – I know it’s incredibly unlikely. But if you can equip an army of monkeys with typewriters, why not dice and cards…?

Respuesta 1:
Well said. This game deserved the SdJ it won last year. And I think this game will continue to see table time for years.

Respuesta 2:
This game does not shine at all for me.
The game looks boring and the gameplay does not overwhelm me.
The more people you play with this game the more luck raises.



Tema 282: Tile placement
Pregunta:
We were wondering about a specific case in our game, 5 minutes ago. Could not find the answer in the previously posted questions, so if anybody can confirm?

Look at this photo:


The game was ending, and this player had no other choice but to pick up these 2 red tiles. We ruled that she could not place them on the 4th line, EVEN if the game was ending after that, and thus even if there was no outcome to consider, just for the simple fact that she could not place a RED tile in this line theoretically.

TLDR: End of the game, very last move, she still has to drop these 2 red tiles on the floor. Did we rule it right?

Respuesta 1:
I’m not sure I agree. The rules say that during the tile laying phase if you can’t move the rightmost tile because there’s not a valid space then the whole row would fall the floor. I’m not sure that prevents you from placing them there.

Also, why are there two red tiles in the first column. That’s not an allowed placement either.

Respuesta 2:
The 2 red tiles are negative points because you can place anywhere. Also the red tile of 3rd or 5th line is false place because you can place only a red tile in a one column.

Where do you see this? All I see in the rulebook for the grey side of the board is this:

Quote:
For a slightly different game, use the gray side of the player boards. Rules are exactly the same as in the normal game, except that when you move a tile from a pattern line to the wall, you may place it on any space of its corresponding wall line. However, as the game progresses, in each of the 5 vertical lines of your wall, no color may appear more than once.
In the normal game you can't put tiles on a pattern line during the Factory Offer phase if there's already a tile of that color in the corresponding line in the wall. Without further clarification in the rulebook I would assume the same is true for the grey side variant, i.e. if you can't eventually score the pattern line because there's no legal placement for the scoring tile then you can't place tiles in that pattern line in the first place, which in this example would result in the 2 red tiles going straight to the floor.

Edit: I take it all back, since the above is based on the old version of the rulebook.

Respuesta 6:
Both red tiles should go to the floor directly, as the only free spaces in this line already have a red tile in each column.

And following that argumentation: something is wrong with the first column, you can't have 2 tiles of the same color in the same a column or row.

The Special case paragraph in the variant rules describes how to proceed if you're about to move the rightmost tile over to the wall and there's no legal space for it. There wouldn't be such a clarification if you weren't allowed to place tiles in a way that leads to applying that special case. So you can place those red tiles there, and, as long as the pattern line isn't completed, you don't have to drop them on the floor.

Ah see, that's a newer version of the rulebook than what I have. My version doesn't have the Special Case paragraph. With this new info I'm now on the side of placing tiles there during the Factory Offer phase is fine.

Special Case (for Variant play) quoted:

Special case: In the wall-tiling phase, it may happen that you are not able to move the rightmost tile of a certain pattern line over to the wall because there is no valid space left for it. In this case, you must immediately place all tiles of that pattern line in your floor line (see Floor line).

Tema 283: Azul, review
Pregunta:
In Azul players are decorating a palace's walls with tiles at the behest of a king by ordering tiles from suppliers but with competitors also fighting for the tiles.

Azul is a drafting game for two to four players. Players select from a pool of tiles split into several groups (or displays) and place their selected color of tile into their personal board for scoring. Scoring is at the end of drafting, when all tiles are taken from the play area. After scoring for a round, new tiles are placed again in the displays and another draft occurs. This repeats until any one player has a completed row of tiles scored on their personal board. There are various rules for drafting, placing, and scoring tiles during the game and the winner is the one who scores the most points at the end of the game.

The tiles in Azul are the biggest reason I can keep playing the game over and over with anyone. The tiles are the focus of the game and the tactile feeling of them when you pluck tiles from the bag or draft them from the displays, is satisfying. The personal boards where all these tiles are placed are thick enough and serviceable, but could sorely use indents or an overlay for keeping tiles in place through the game. The scoring track on each personal board is serviceable, again, but the use of a seemingly boring black cube on a track (that could use an indent also) is fine for scoring but unexciting compared to the tiles. Overall the tiles are the focus of the game and that's what my rating is weighted toward.



Components: A

The theme isn't paper thin but it also isn't truly integrated into the game. Azul is an abstract so there is no economy or cost for buying tiles, you merely select them. The theme works but at no point in my plays did I think to myself, "I'm sure the king will enjoy my wall." This is a game about collecting points by selecting the colors you need at any given time, not about making the prettiest display. This theme could have been replaced with any number of others and it truly doesn't feel unique in that regard. That all being said the theme isn't why you play this game- the excellent game-play is!

Theme : C

Azul is a pure drafting game. There are many other games featuring a draft central to their game but none as hyper focused on making drafting quick AND deep:quick in that, for your turn, you merely select one color of tile from a display (or floor), deep referring to how much thought you have to expend finding the order in which you take tiles to fit your board and the relative demand for them that other players have. Azul's entire interaction between players is in the draft and, due to how the rules of how placing work, its commonplace for players to purposefully draft a tile just because of its demand or how much another player may need it. No other drafting game has had "hate drafting" (drafting with intent to block another player's intentions) and yet still been fun for me to play. This is due to Azul's flow of play. Each turn is simply taking one kind of tile, so there isn't much turnaround from when a person hate drafts you to when you are presented with another opportunity for a better move.

Gameplay: A+

My spouse says this is a game she can see herself playing twenty years from now. I've played hundreds of different board games at this point in my life and there aren't many games I can say I'll be playing twenty years from now. It's been over a year since we started playing Azul and the number of days it wasn't played or talked about in that time is in the minority. Azul is a special game and if you like drafting you owe it to your twenty years older self to get this game.

Pros: fast turns, tactile, hard choices, player interaction

Cons: personal boards need improvement, scoring cube dull, theme replaceable

Overall score: A (9.4)

That's what I was thinking. I think we've reached market saturation.

It makes sense that we'd see some popular games here and there too.

Tema 287: Can you scrap a line from a previous turn?
Pregunta:
Our game has been on pause for almost an hour and I cannot find ANYTHING about this question. Last turn of the round and my husband wants to move the 2 red tiles on the last line to the floor so he can pick up the blue tiles and put them in the last line. Otherwise he would have to put all the blue tiles on the floor.

Anyone know what the rule is on moving tiles that were set in a previous turn?

Respuesta 1:
There's no ability to move anything from the left side anywhere but to the right side, and only when the row is full and the round complete.

So your husband has to leave the red tiles there.

This is one of the central strategic points of the game - try not to leave a row that's not full that will carry over to future rounds that constrains your options.

Respuesta 2:
You can't do that. You can't find anything in the rulebook about it because in general rules don't list all the things you can't do, just the things you can do.

Respuesta 3:
Once tiles go on the left, the only way to move them is to fill up that line. Yes, this can leave you trapped towards the end of the game.

Respuesta 4:
Kelci J
@Kjagge
Anyone know what the rule is on moving tiles that were set in a previous turn?
The rule is:

B. Wall-tiling A) Go through your pattern from top to bottom. Move the rightmost tile of each completed line...

...

Like Dan commented, there's no reason to imagine you can move those tiles away some other way (e.g. simply scrapping them if you want to) if the rules don't mention that other way.

It's impossible for rules to list all the (infinitely many) things which you cannot do. They list the things which you can do. Concentrate on what the rules allow.

Respuesta 5:
"The rules don't say I can't do (X) so I can" is commonly known as The Munchkin Fallacy and is one of the more rampant examples of bad gamer etiquette in our hobby. As several people have already mentioned, it would be impossible to list all the things that one cannot do as part of a game. Even when a game does specifically call out an individual example of something a player cannot do -- usually as a result of frequent confusion during playtesting, or as a specific exception to a more general situation -- that cannot be taken as indication that anything not specifically called out in the rules is therefore allowed.

My general reaction to an invocation of the Munchkin Fallacy is to draw back my arm and make a fist while smirking and stating that "the rules also don't state that I can't punch you in the face with total impunity and immunity to legal or personal retribution, now do they?" I'm a scrawny overweight middle-aged man, and that still usually gets the point across.

Respuesta 6:
Talking about gaming etiquette, it's very bad form by the husband in this story, who'd rather stall a game on the premise of an absent rule than accept his position with good grace.

I wouldn't play with him again, OP.

Respuesta 7:
Hahaha, well I was the one who stalled it. He first said “if the rules don’t say it, I can do it!” Then said he just wouldn’t and would move the blue to the floor. It could have been a game winning move and I didn’t want to be the reason he lost......turns out he won either way!

Thanks!

Tema 290: improvement for azul v2.0 -- spout design added to vacuform component holder
Pregunta:
played azul for the first time two weeks ago.

bought azul for the family last week. we've played it nearly a dozen times since then.

we love the game!

here's a suggestion for the next version or release of the game that wouldn't add significant cost to the box:

- a spout design added to the corner of the vacuformed game component insert

on pages 4 and 5 of the english directions, it is suggested that we put tiles in the lid of the box during the "wall-tiling" and "preparing the next round" phases of the game.

but as anyone who has done this and then faced the task of emptying a box lid of the beautiful flat tiles knows, this can lead to tile spillage as they stack atop each other to only tumble in groups too large for the mouth of the bag.

instead, i recommend (and would only ask a free game of azul or the azul-glass tiles game to give to a friend as compensation) that you change just one corner of the main cavity--where the cloth bag and factory circles go--into the shape of a sloped spout.

that would make it much easier to just toss tiles into that space during the game and then pour them easily back into the bag with much less tile spillage.

again, love the game! the tiles, boards, and overall artwork are a joy to behold as we play.

Respuesta 1:
We use a large Bit Bowl, and it works perfect. When you need to dump, you can unlatch one corner and it makes a little spout.

Respuesta 2:
We have an old Crown Royal bag that we place the excess tiles in. We'll just pour this into the Azul bag when it's time to replenish.

Respuesta 3:
I dislike this too. Until we just changed to putting our discards into another cloth bag, I just tipped the box lid up about halfway, and manually raked the stacked tiles down to the corner.

It seemed the only flaw in an otherwise elegant game.

To have the discard pile be an integral part of the game, and dealing with the pile being something that happens 2 or 3 times in a game sometimes, I feel like there should have been a better mechanism. Your spout idea is a good plan.

Respuesta 4:
Azul 2 solved this using the glass tower. We had a red tinted bag made to match the blue one that comes with Azul, and just switch bags when we empty one.



Tema 291: Where is the list of components?
Pregunta:

Thank you, grazie!



Tema 292: Are most games just 5 rounds?
Pregunta:
I just bought this game and did a few two-player test games by myself to get a feel for the flow of it. It seems to me that most games would just be 5 rounds because the first couple rows of your wall are very easy to place a tile in each round (especially the first row), so I would think that most people would have that first row filled (maybe the second row too) in the first 5 rounds, thus ending the game. Is that the norm? I’m I missing something?

Respuesta 1:
I think I've had a game go to 7 rounds once, but yeah mostly they will be 5-6 rounds.

Just checking that you're not scoring rows as soon as they are filled. Remember that a round doesn't end until all the tiles have been drafted. That's a very common mistake by new players, apparently...

Yes, I believe I’m doing that correctly.

Respuesta 3:
I think all of our games have only gone 5 rounds.

Respuesta 4:
Not many people I have played with try and finish the game as soon as possible, i.e. five rounds filling one or both of the top two rows.

There are much more scoring opportunities available if you let the game run longer.

If you think you will win by rushing the end game then go for it, but it is not the only option.

I can't say that I count the number of rounds our games normally go, but I doubt if any of them have finished in five.

Respuesta 5:
Another common beginner mistake is to pick up a bunch of tiles at once (usually from the center) and place them into multiple rows simultaneously. For instance, perhaps I take 6 tiles from the center, and place 5 into the bottom row and one in the top row.

This is illegal.

Enforcing this rule makes it harder to fill the first row or two; to pull a single tile or maybe two tiles, you generally have to do it from one of the disc lots and not from the center.

That’s what I has hoping to hear. If filling up your top row first was a common winning strategy, I would have been disappointed because that lacks depth. I suspect there are different levels of play. Beginners might end most their games that way but more advanced players do not.

That’s probably why getting columns and 5 of a color are so many more points than getting rows, because the designer wants to discourage just filling up your top row. That is probably always a losing strategy against a good player (at least I hope so).

Respuesta 7:
But if I speed up the game by filling the top row, the other player might not get the opportunity to complete a color or column.

Possibly. But remember that a canny player could fill most of a column in a single round.

Respuesta 9:
Taught this game to a friend today. I just really don’t like the “one row ends it” rule. Just seems too easy and bland to me. It bugs me. So the way we decided to play was to make the final round triggered by someone getting all 5 of a color on their wall. In my opinion this enhanced the game and broadened the strategies. We did two games with this new rule; the first went 7 rounds, the second went 6 rounds.

Also, I really think the little individual scoring tracks on everyone’s board was ill-conceived. Twice my friend accidentally knocked hers off her scoring track and we couldn’t remember exactly where it was supposed to be. Next time I play, I’ll probably just take one of the extra player boards (unless, of course, we have 4 players) and use it as a common score track, out of reach of accidental knocking or jarring.

Respuesta 10:
I can clearly see now, though, why the designer choose to have one completed row force the end of the game. Because if you go into a round with two or three rows already completed, those pattern rows become completely useless and your options are severely restricted, leading to several tiles falling onto your floor line because it’s impossible for you to place them. So if you adopt this new rule be mindful that going into a final round with multiple rows completed can be brutal.

The rules on ending the game are fine as they are and I would advise you persevere with it. I completely agree with you about the awful score tracks; it's much better to record scores with pencil and paper.

Respuesta 14:
If a player sets out to complete the game in 5 rounds, that player will tend to lose against a player who doesn't pursue that strategy.

So yes, it's very easy to make a game last only 5 rounds. But if you always pursue this strategy, you'll probably never get any good at the game.

Edit:
Or put another way. Let's imagine that a game of Azul is always played over 5 rounds, regardless of board status. Why would you prioritise playing to the top row every round?

That is a good point. I’ve been playing it on http://boardwebgames.com and the rule doesn’t seem to bug me as much as I thought it would. I’ll probably keep playing it that way in table games, at least for the time being.

Respuesta 16:
Most of our games ended in 5 rounds until I started actively blocking the play of others. Half our games still go 5 rounds, but now that I am forcing people to break tiles and fail to complete rows, six is equally likely.

The bonus for a row is 2 pts. The bonus for a column is 7 pts. The bonus for all 5 of one color is 10 points. Should completing a row be your main objective? Seems unlikely...

Respuesta 19:
We never seem to struggle to have someone complete a row, columns and a full set of tiles, even with attempted blocking. The strategy is to play fast and well.

Edit: and we definitely have the rules right.

Respuesta 20:
To clarify, everyone will want to be in position to end the game quickly in case they are the one with two columns and a complete set of tiles. And even trying to block, there are often enough options for someone thinking through the possibilities to do that. So ending the game quickly is not the objective in and of itself, but it’s smart to be able to. And if you do that, the probably leader will end it after five rounds.

Yes 5 rounds here too. We play as a family often and are looking for high scores while being competitive. Azul SGOS is also designed and forced for 5 rounds only.

Exactly. The more tiles you score every round, i.e. move them to the tiling area, the more opportunity you have the following round to build on those existing tiles for bigger scoring.

Tema 294: If You Could Only Keep One: Azul vs. Sagrada vs. Tiny Towns (A Comparative Review)
Pregunta:
If You Could Only Keep One: Azul vs. Sagrada vs. Tiny Towns

An IGUESSIMANERDNOW comparative review featuring James and Mike









James: Getting rid of games is hard. We enjoy all three listed as relatively quick games we can teach to new and experienced gamers alike. They all have nice components and similar gameplay where everyone grabs something from the middle, then puts it on their personal player board according to some restrictions in an effort to gain the most point by game's end.

Mike: If you have a smaller collection, you might decide to only get (or in our case, keep) one of these games. In an effort to decide on which of the 3 would stay in our collection, we ranked them in 5 categories: Production, The Puzzle, The Action, Variability and Overall.


James: Agree? Disagree? Tell us what you think in the comments below. Let the dissension commence!



Production

The artwork and the pretty bits



image courtesy of mercopparis


3rd Place: Tiny Towns

J: This was tough. Tiny Towns has fantastic production with nice, chunky colourful blocks and buildings, tarot-sized cards with pleasant artwork and serviceable player boards.

M: I love all the different shapes and colours of the buildings. Also, kudos is deserved for making the game colour-blind friendly. Taking bronze in this case is not a knock on Tiny Towns at all, as the other games are two of the nicest-looking ones in recent memory.






image courtesy of jipipu


2nd Place: Sagrada

J: From pulling the pretty, translucent dice out of the lovely cloth bag to placing them carefully in your dual-layered player boards to create a beautiful stain-glass window, this game is an optical and tactile pleasure.

M: It was probably the prettiest one in my collection for a short while. One thing I do hate though is when I have to try to airdrop one of those tiny dice in between 4 others. I need to invest in some dice tongs or something.







image courtesy of jipipu


1st Place: Azul

J: Of all the games in my collection, this is the one I most want to stick in my mouth. The chunky candy tiles, the gorgeously unique art work…

M: It’s so pretty. Anyone who sees this game immediately wants to fondle the tiles and then play…while still continuing to fondle the tiles. Something to prevent the score tracker from being bumped would be appreciated, but that’s getting pretty nit-picky.





The Puzzle

Putting the pretty bits down for points



image courtesy of henk.rolleman



3rd Place: Azul

J: The puzzle provided by Azul’s player board causes the lowest amount of angst and is the least mentally taxing of the three. There’s still plenty to think about though (not repeating colours, trying to balance which bonuses to go for, etc.)

M: I do really love being rewarded for scoring connecting tiles. That, along with end-of-game bonuses, gives lots to ponder when choosing tiles and makes for some very satisfying rounds when you plan well.





image courtesy of power_wong


2nd Place: Tiny Towns

J: This little puzzle is certainly the crunchiest of the three. What starts off as an open and breezy field, quickly becomes a suffocating glass case that you try to Houdini your way out of. Just when you make a litttttle bit of progress it closes in again and you think there’s no way you can get out of this one… but then you do…arghhh but then it closes in again worse than before!

M: I love watching first time players switch from “Do do do… this is fun!” to “*&%$ this is brutal” in the span of a few minutes. The spatial element combined with the different scoring mechanisms of each building and how they interact with each other is really clever. I’ve definitely left this game with my share of cerebrum strains.






image courtesy of aadrian13


1st Place: Sagrada

J: Just the right amount of crunch. Trying to maximize points while following the placement rules makes for a very tricky brain tickler that strikes a perfect balance for me of being complex enough that I feel challenged, but not so demanding that I can’t play it on a weeknight after dinner.

M: The fact that you can choose your own difficulty at the beginning of the game is fantastic as well. I also love the addition of the tool cards as a way to cleverly escape a tight spot.





The Action

How you get the pretty bits in the first place



image courtesy of Floodgate



3rd Place: Sagrada

J: Choosing dice from a pool is good. It’s fine. During drafts in the early game, you have the demeanour of Snoop Dogg on a Sunday drive: “Oh no, you took the one I wanted. It’s okay I’ll make do with this little beauty…” Then as the game progresses toward the end, you become more like Yosemite Sam in rush hour after a long day at work: “All I need is one yellow, just one ye- . There it is! I swear to Tarnation if you take that yellow di… GAHHRRGHHH!” (flips table).

M: There’s quite a bit to think about when you do choose those dice. Some interaction is present here, but simply grabbing a die from a pool just isn’t as interesting to me as what you do in the other two games.






image courtesy of kalchio


2nd Place: Tiny Towns

J: Tiny Towns features two methods for getting your building materials. In the first one, the active player chooses and everyone else has to follow. This works well with lower player counts and the added interaction adds a lot to the game. On your turn, it feels amazing and you can finally breathe again, but then you wait anxiously for the next player to choose, hoping they say glass. When they do, you share a moment of joy. If they don’t (or even worse choose wheat AGAIN), they’re dead to you.

M: The other method (recommended for higher player counts) involves flipping cards to determine what resources to place. This removes the player interaction, but creates a nice “we’re all in this together” atmosphere.






image courtesy of Badass Vio



1st Place: Azul

J: This is the first time during this comparison where I feel like there’s any distance between the games. Grabbing the pretty tiles that you want and pushing others into the middle is such a clever drafting mechanism. It’s fresh, fun, breezy, thinky, tense and sometimes hilarious all at the same time.

M: Here’s a snippet of my thoughts during the draft: “Don’t you dare take those 3 black tiles you son of a…”, “mmmmm look at those 5 juicy yellows”, “when is someone going to bite the bullet and open up the middle? YES! thank you!”, “she really need those reds…hey maybe I could also use red…yeah I think I will”, “uh oh…someone’s going to end up with a lot of blues here…oh my gosh there’s like 8 blues now haha this is going to be hilarious…wait what if it ends up being me?…damn it! Why is it always me!?”






Variability





image courtesy of henk.rolleman




3rd Place: Azul

J: Sure, the tiles will come out differently and you have to adapt your strategy to what other players make available, but there’s not much that changes from game to game.

M: When it starts to feel stale, you can try playing on the other side of the board to spice things up a bit, but it can start to get a bit samey after repeated plays. This is the type of game that once you introduce it to new players, they want to play over and over. So if you’re showing it to lots of people (like I did) you can end up burning out on it.






image courtesy of argentetbury


2nd Place: Sagrada

J: We already mentioned that we love the fact that you get to choose your puzzle difficulty at the start of the game. Having a different puzzle along with changing objectives and various tool cards provides a lot of variability so each game doesn’t feel the same as the one before.

M: There’s also an upcoming expansion that will add variable player powers, trickier objectives and some sort of special dice.





image courtesy of kalchio


1st Place: Tiny Towns

J: This is one of the biggest positives of Tiny Towns for me. Each game will feature 7 different buildings, plus each player's special monument. Six of these buildings have 4 different versions to choose from, all of which score points and behave differently. Combine that with having a different game-changing monument every game and you’ve got A LOT of variability in that box.

M: I love that they were all included in the base game. It’s really fun trying out all the different combinations in the game. Lots to discover here.







Overall

Which one will we keep?




image courtesy of kalchio



3rd Place: Tiny Towns

J: Tiny Towns is a very solid design. Production is excellent and there is a ton of variability included in the base game. I really do enjoy it, but it’s a little more mentally demanding than I usually prefer with this type of game. I’ve had quite a bit of success introducing it to non-BGG types, but it hasn’t grabbed people in quite the same way as the other two.

M: The relative newcomer might be suffering a bit here due to the lack of plays as it hasn’t had a chance to burrow itself into my heart quite like the other two. If you want a quick, crunchy abstract for a fantastic price that plays up to 6 and can even be enjoyed as a solo puzzle, this is an excellent choice.






image courtesy of desenclos


2nd Place: Sagrada

J: Sagrada is lovely. It’s gorgeous out on the table, has just the right amount of puzzley crunch and the tool cards provide opportunities for some really clever moves.

M: It is more of a solitary affair than the others, but is also my favourite of the three to play solo. In a sense, it’s a very calming experience just simply surveying the pretty dice and choosing one to add to your window, but then figuring out that puzzle can also be pretty brutal at times.





image courtesy of LordBalder


1st Place: Azul

J: Tiny Towns? It’s good (voice inflection on the It’s). Sagrada? It’s good (inflection on the good). Azul? It’s good (lower voice on good). The combination of the ingenious tile draft with the unique tile placement puzzle is just so. damn. smooth. There is an incredible balance of simple yet satisfying that make this game a hit with all types at the table.

M: Azul has become a go-to game for me in so many situations just because it’s been so universally enjoyed by others. Double date dinner get together with Clue players? Azul. A nice leisurely game with Grandma over tea? Azul. A quick cutthroat filler with the gaming buddy? You get the picture. I don’t know if any game in my collection is more of a “sure thing” for new players than Azul. I love the oooooh’s and aaaah's when I first take it out of the box and later watching the lightbulb flash in their eyes when they begin to understand how it works. I love the laughter and interaction that the game allows during the draft and then the inevitable “let’s play again!”, “where’d you get this?” or “we should have another game night” that immediately follows. I enjoy all 3 games, but if I’m keeping one? Azul.

Just a personal preference. I feel like the character of the game is slightly different in two players, as it often changes to "who will end up dropping that pile on the floor" instead of trying to complete the rows in an effective manner. I realize that's essential part of the gameplay, but I am enjoying 4p games more because it seems to be a lot less common in those.

Respuesta 10:
The "fiddliness" of Sagrada, the trickiness of its placement restrictions, and the difficulty in observing what other players were doing on with their boards and whether or not they had violated a rule (especially for new players) caused me to abandon Sagrada. Azul suffers from none of the above issues with Sagrada, and has a more enjoyable length. You can get painted into a corner with Azul, but it's a much greater problem with Sagrada. Azul is the best abstract multi-player that scales perfectly with all of its player counts and is the best abstract that's come out during my involvement in this hobby.

My other favorite abstract of recent introduction, is  . It suffers from a long setup time, but is otherwise a lot of fun to play.

Respuesta 18:
I have Azul and Tiny Towns, and think both have a place and aren't really competing for the same exact space in my collection, and get pulled out at different times.

Azul is definitely the sure-fire hit game that can is easy to learn hard to master. It won the 2018 Spiel Des Jahres, yeah, you should keep this one. It's easy to overplay though. I wish they had included the factory promo powers on the opposite side of some of the discs, to add a tad of spice to shake things up for the vets training new recruits so much. it would have been a pretty trivial and worthwhile addition.

Tiny Towns is less of an abstract to me, and in a different category as I see it. Yes, its spatial placing of cubes too, fair. But with the powers and categories and synergies of the buildings alongside the theme being sold so well with its mechanical flavor and very nice meeples, it really make this feel like a city building combo puzzle and a more main event game than the others. It's more like a 3D roll and write with some fun crunch? It IS appealing to those who like Azul, which I see as a good thing as i try to level up more of my friends over time. And it's replayability and variability is WAY better, as you said. It's similar to Kingdom Builder in that way, another fave of mine to play with less experienced gamers, more similar to this than Azul in many ways. I like both of these games in my collection and hadn't really put them in the same box myself until I read this review.

I have not played Sagrada, but haven't been that drawn to it despite the praise. I think that's because it looks to lie between these 2 in so many ways and i'd rather step up or down. It looks so abstract and a bit too rainbow busy to me vs Azul's simplicity and muted colors. I don't need too many elegant abstracts in my collection, and certainly not ones that aren't as quick a super-filler, but less than a full meal on the other hand. And it seems to have least interaction to boot? Sounds like it has some more knobs to turn than Azul for an abstract, and I'm sure I'd like it, but I have a hunch I really don't need this in my collection at all.

great review!

At the time it was a choice between Azul and Sagrada for me ( tiny towns was not out yet) and i chose Azul because of the hot looks, don't really like the stained glass look and if sagrada was colored like Azul i would still not be able to choose.

My sister especially loves the game so i told her hey don't get the same game get Sagrada or Tiny Towns (she loves triple town on mobile which plays somewhat the same). But after showing her and my fam a vid of said games they could barely raise a eyebrow.

Sometimes it's best to also check with the group you play the most what they will like aswell, luckiliy for me i just had a good gamble.



Tema 295: [The Tabletop Times] Review - Azul

Details

 Designer: Michael Kiesling

 Artists: Philippe Guérin and Chris Quilliams

 Publisher: Next Move Games

 Player Count: 2-4 

Overview

Azul is a board game based on the process of azulejos, a type of painted tin-glazed ceramic tilework popular in Spain and Portugal. It originated in Persia and spread to Europe in the 13th century. Nominally, Azul sees you take on the role of a Portuguese artist, tasked by King Manuel I with decorating the walls of the Royal Palace of Evora.

In reality, Azul is an abstract tile drafting game, where players race to fill in their personal player board with brightly coloured tiles in the azulejo style.



How to Play

The rulebook for Azul is short and straight forward and can be found here. If you’d rather watch a rule explanation video, this is the best one I could find.

Set-up for Azul is quick. Each player receives a personal player board and a scoring marker which is placed on the scoring track on the player board. A number of “factory tiles”, dependent on the number of players, are placed in a circle, within reach of all players. The first player tile is placed in the middle of the factory tiles. All of the coloured tiles are added to the draw bag (100 tiles in total, 20 of each colour/pattern). Four tiles are drawn from the bag and placed on each factory.

The aim of the game is to score victory points. Points scoring is done at the end of each round. Each tile successfully placed on a player’s wall will score points according to the number of adjacent tiles already on the wall. For example, a tile on its own scores one point, a tile with two tiles directly to the left of it in a row scores three points, and tile with a tile directly to the left and right and two directly above scores six point (three points for the row and three for the column). This might sound complicated but page 5 of the rulebook outlines it effectively with a series of pictures. Negative points are scored for excess tiles, which are placed on your “floor line” (explained below), and for possessing the first player tile. In addition, bonuses are scored at the end of the game for having completed rows and/or columns on your player board, and for having put down all the tiles of a colour/design.

Each round, the first player chooses one type of tile from one factory tile and takes all of all of the tiles of that type from that factory. These are placed on the lines on the player board according to the following rules: all tiles must be placed on the same line of the player board, only one type of tile can be placed on each row, surplus tiles are placed in the floor area at the bottom of the player board and score minus at the end of the round. The remaining tiles from that factory are pushed into the area in middle of the factory tiles. The player to the left of the first player then chooses a factory in the same manner. Players can also choose to take tiles from the middle area, according to the same rules. The first player to take from the middle must also take the first player token, which is placed in the floor line of the player board.

The round ends when all tiles have been drafted. At the end of the round, completed rows of tiles allow players to place a tile on their wall and score points. The game ends when one player has completed a full row of their wall and end of game bonuses are then counted.




Gameplay

The aesthetics of Azul, its beautiful artwork, and its simple rulebook all hide one fundamental thing about Azul, it is ruthless. Azul, particularly at 2-players, is one of the meanest games I have ever played. This might not be immediately apparent because your experience with Azul will likely follow these three stages. In your first game of Azul, you’re likely to have your head down trying to just fill up the lines on your player board so you can place as many tiles as possible, so far so pleasant. Next, you’ll realise that if you plan ahead and try to place tiles that are adjacent to one another, you’ll score a lot more points. Things are still pleasant, players are just moving beautiful tiles around and getting points. The final stage is where Azul shows its true colours. Once players have come to terms with their own boards they’ll start to look to their opponents’ boards.

Hate drafting, is a key strategy in Azul and I think it’s fair to say that it has more bite in Azul than in a lot of other games. This is because of the points you lose for floor tiles. Any tiles you, can’t fit on a single line are placed at the bottom of your player board to score minus points at the end of the round. What’s more, the number of points you lose per tile increases the more tiles you have at the bottom of the player board. This is a major reason why Azul is so mean and why hate drafting if such a strategic concern. Not only are you trying to deny your opponent the perfect tile to finish a line and score big, you’re also planning out the next three sets of tiles you’ll take at the end of the round in order to leave your opponent with six tiles they can’t place, so that they’ll lose 11 points in one go.



Whether you like Azul or not will be largely down to whether you read the last paragraph and thought “that sounds fun!” or “that sounds like hell”. If players are good natured and willing to get their elbows out, Azul is a very enjoyable experience. If one player would take hate drafting to heart, or if a player feels uncomfortable with interfering with another player’s plans, then Azul might become an unpleasant experience.

It should be noted that, mechanically, Azul is a simple experience. Every turn, players will do the same thing, take all of one type of tile from a factory or the middle of the factories. However, this framework provides endless interesting decisions, risk-reward scenarios, and most importantly, leads to players looking up, seeing what their opponents are doing, and trying to figure out what they’ll do on their next turn, because it matters. Decisions in Azul feel interesting. This means that Azul is a game you can pull out, play in 30 minutes, and feel like you’ve played something with meaty decisions, something short games often fail to capture.

Player Counts

Azul can be played with 2-4 players. What player count works best for you will depend on what you want from Azul. I would be of the opinion that Azul is at its best with two-players. At two-players, player interaction is high, and it is easier to plan moves a few turns in advance. It is also much easier with two-players to keep track of your opponent’s board state, as there are less pieces of information to parse. Azul is definitely at its most strategic at two players and players have a greater sense of agency.

The key problems with three and four players are the increased downtime (with arguably no really gameplay benefit), the lack of agency, since planned out turns are more likely to be thwarted by someone else’s tile drafting (not necessarily because they are looking to block you, but just by chance), and the information overload (particularly at four players) which effectively decreases the level of player interaction.

Having said all this, I can imagine some people preferring higher player counts. As mentioned above, Azul can be a mean game and the increased information at higher player counts leads to a notable decrease in hate drafting. At higher player counts it’s much harder to plan turns in advance, which some players may not do anyway, meaning that players must react to the board state as it comes to their turn. This gives the game a much more relaxed feel. Finally, increased downtime in a game isn’t always a bad thing. If players are looking for a game that allows them to relax with their friends while partaking in a shared activity, Azul at four-players might be preferably to them.



Variability

Overall variability in Azul is minimal, with most games feeling similar as bonus scoring never changes (unlike games like Sagrada or Isle of Skye). While player boards are two-sided, allowing for a looser variant to be played where tiles can be placed almost anywhere instead of on specific spots, my experience of the variant was that it made the game less strategic and less interesting.

The setup of each round is highly variable due to the random drawing of a large pool of tiles. Given the large number of tiles, you’re unlikely to see the same initial board state twice. This means that a dominant strategy is unlikely to emerge for how best take you opening turns. 

The Theme

Azul’s theme feels a bit pasted on. It’s an abstract game and the brief paragraph on the theme in the rulebook really feels like it’s just an excuse to have beautiful, patterned tiles. To be honest, I’m OK with that. Depending on the game and the player group, theme isn’t always necessary. Ultimately, it’s a nice idea but not core to the game.

The closest Azul comes to having mechanics related to the azulejos process is picking tiles off factories, though why all other tiles are pushed in to the centre, I don’t know. Also, tiles that don’t fit into the lines on your player board fall to the ground (the bottom of your player board) broken, this is a clever thematic mechanism but is still heavily abstracted.

For the most part, I would imagine that the theme will mostly be ignored by players during games.



Art and Components

Azul is quite simple beautiful. The graphic design is sharp and the colours pop. The game may not evoke the theme too well, but the art and components evoke a feeling of Summer sun and heat, on the Iberian Peninsula. The tiles are the high point of the components. They are highly tactile, in a way I can only compare to playing games with metal coins. They are a joy to hold as you decide on what line to place them, fumbling them around in your hand. This makes drawing tiles each round immensely satisfying, much more so than games like Altiplano or Orléans. This is further helped by the beautiful bag that comes with the game. Boards and factory tiles are made from thick card and the box comes with a functional plastic insert that is in keeping with the style of the game.

I do have some minor criticisms of the components. Firstly, while most of the tiles have beautiful patterns on them, two of the tile types are just blank tiles, blue and red. I’m not sure why this decision was made, perhaps to keep print costs lower or make things clearer. Either way it doesn’t feel right, so it’s a negative point for an otherwise beautiful game. Replacement patterned tiles are available from Next Move Games, but keep in mind if you think you would need to have them, that this is effectively raising the price you will pay for the game and should factor into your value judgement.

A final criticism of the components is of the scoring tracks on the player boards. Scores are marked by moving a small black cube along the track. The graphic design of the track is clear and makes it easy to do scoring, due to the markings of every five and ten points. However, the player boards are very smooth and if the boards are bumped, you can easily lose track of your score. This is a similar problem to the player boards in Terraforming Mars. A solution could have been to have dual-layered player boards like Scythe, however I understand that this would likely raise the retail price of the game. In any case this is a minor issue and rarely causes problems. If it is a problem, numerous third-party sellers have plastic overlays for the player boards available.



The Verdict

Azul won the 2018 Spiel des Jahres and it is easy to see why. Azul is a simple game, that anyone can play, after a brief rules explanation, but there’s enough strategic depth to keep hobbyists interested and to keep players coming back for more. As noted in the gameplay section, Azul is a confrontational game and players should consider whether that is something they enjoy before making a purchase.

Azul is also beautiful. Beauty in a board game is not something players should scoff at. It means it is much easier to get to the table. This is especially important in a game with a low rules overhead, that you might want to introduce to reluctant family members or people with little experience of modern board games. Azul offers a good jumping off point for people new to the hobby despite its rather pasted on theme.

Tema 296: Explain game ending early because of filled in row
Pregunta:
OK, so I'm a bit confused when people say that they ended the game early because they filled in a horizontal row.

Keeping in mind that we have only played 2 players (so far), but following the rules for a 2 player game it states to put out 5 factory displays and then put 4 tiles per factory. 4 tiles times 5 factories is 20 tiles per round. 20 tiles times 5 rounds is 100 tiles, which is all of them, in 5 rounds. Tiles that are not used on your wall do not go back in the bag to be pulled out again. So all tiles are done in 5 rounds. If you can only move 1 tile from your pattern lines into your wall per row per round, then the game can't end "early". You have to go through 5 rounds in order to be able to close a horizontal row with 5 tiles. And 5 rounds is the max, cuz after 5 rounds, there are no tiles left. So how does one end the game early?

Respuesta 1:
There's kind of two parts to your question.

1. Some people have incorrectly believed that you can move tiles across as soon as you have filled a row. This is incorrect, you only move tiles across when a round is completed. Otherwise it would be possible to end the game in five TURNS.

2. the game does NOT end when there are no tiles left. If there are no tiles left, any discarded tiles go back in the bag to be distributed again. The game only ends when at least one player has completed a row. Therefore, it is possible for a player to end the game "early" by completing a row before anyone else, if they are lagging behind.

Respuesta 2:
The game ends when someone finishes a horizontal row. One way some people see as a winning strategy is to rush the full row ASAP while others are trying to fill columns or sets of 5 of a color. If everyone else isn't watching, there's a chance it can win due to the points during scoring and the 2 pt bonus that no one else might have.

If I see someone place two horizontal in the first two turns, I start watching what they want and pull it either to my board so they can't get it or to the center. Hopefully, everyone else dumps the same one they want and force them to pull more than what they need. That kills whatever bonus they were aiming for.

Someone wants to try for the cheese win, I will hate-draft them as much as I can.

Respuesta 3:
Tiles that do not go into your wall, do not immediately go back into the bag. They go into some other space (maybe the box lid). When the bag gets low, then you refresh the bag with the tiles that were going into the some other space

Putting the non-wall tiles somewhere else and only later into the bag stops you from seeing the same tiles coming back again too soon

This I totally got wrong. And I just read it in the rules now in the C. Preparing the next round. If the bag is empty, refill it......

We were not doing this and ended the game after 5 rounds and there were no tiles in the bag. This would also explain why we were never close to the scores that people report here on BGG. I don't think either of us cracked 80. Now I can see how there's definitely an opportunity to do so, and in all honesty changes a lot about the game.

Thanks for clarifying!!! Much appreciated. Now I better re-read the rules to  !!!

Makes as much sense to me as anything, that splits the game up into just "make my row" and "keep opponent from scoring" which is a lot easier to evaluate than "what are all the different ways I could get points and which is more efficient/likely and what is available with what came out and what I have?"

Respuesta 8:
When we play we have 2 ways to stop the game and choose one of them :

1. There must be 2 horizontal rows filled.

2. One row must be filled and you must have 5 of the same tile in your wall.

Both are playing very well.

Tema 297: Question regarding the First Player tile and Floor scoring
Pregunta:
Hi,

I'm confused about the First Player tile and the Floor Tile row (naming may be incorrect, but I'm referring to the negative points that represent broken tiles).

Let's say at the end of a round, I have three tiles in my Floor Tile row, the first of which is the First Player token. It goes back into the center at the start of the next round. I now have a blank space in the first spot of my Floor Tile row (because the others accumulate and persist until the row is filled, right?).

Does my next Floor Tile backfill into that now vacant first space, so I'm back to three spaces counting against me, or does it get placed in the next consecutive open space, so I now have four spaces counting against me, the first of which has been vacated by the floor tile?

Thanks!

Edit: spelling

Respuesta 1:
The penalty for floor tiles is scored after you score your completed rows and then the tiles in the floor line are removed from your player mat in preparation for the next round. (All of them.)

Respuesta 2:
Incidentally, I strongly approve of your pro-Vikes stance and strongly disapprove of your pro-Noles stance.

Respuesta 7:
Okay, so you have gone through the first round, placed your tiles and then totaled your points, taking away what's on the Floor Tile line. It says the First Player Tile is a "regular tile", but it should not be put in the box, but in front of you. This is where we got lost.

Does it stay in front of you for the rest of the game?
Does it get put in your Floor Tile line each round?
Does it get put back in the center to be collected with the center cast-offs?

Thanks for helping this newbie.

Respuesta 8:
Simply put:

The 1st player marker starts in the middle of the table.

The first player to draft from the middle ALSO takes the 1st player marker and places it in their floor line.

At the end of that round, that player scores their penalty points, and places the 1st player tile back in the middle of the table.

That player starts the next round.

I believe that in the *extremely* rare case that every market gets 4 of the same colour tile (so there's nothing dropped on the floor), then the person who was first player that round would keep the 1st player tile, but would not get the penalty for it.

Why? I would think that the (n+1)th player to act, having no other choice, would have to draft that tile. It's still a tile, and the round is not over until all the tiles are drafted.

It seems a fuzzy case not clearly covered by the rules (probably because in reality it will almost certainly never happen.)

The rules say that on your turn you have to pick "all tiles of the same color" from a factory or the center.

And it seems clearly intended that this must be a positive number of tiles of some color, so in the case that only the start player tile is left, you couldn't fulfill that.

Unless the start player tile is considered its own sixth color (white), I guess. But then if white is one of the tile colors, that would mean that in a typical case where there are other tiles along with the white start player tile, that you could to take only the start player tile, i.e. all of the white tiles, and no tiles of one of the 5 normal colors. Which is surely not intended.

Hmm. Fun rules conundrum.

It is interesting, but the previous poster’s comment solves it for me. It’s a tile; the round can’t end until it is taken.

You are right that the rules specify taking like tiles, but that can easily be applied to the start player, as there is none like it so it will be taken singly if that’s all that’s left. The rules also specify it must be taken when a player takes other tiles from the center when first, but that doesn’t conflict with anything, it just provides an additional special case.

Do you believe that's intended? The rules don't seem to disallow it, if you're considering the start tile to be of a take-able tile color just like others "normal" tiles.

Also: in the first edition, the start player "tile" wasn't even a tile, but a cardboard token, as I understand it.

The first step of each round is this:

@Rulebook
The starting player places the starting player marker in the center of the table and then takes the first turn.
So if you have the first player tile, you score the negative point(s) for it, put it in front of you, and put the rest of the floor tiles in the box. Then, as first player, you repopulate the factory displays, put the first player tile into the center, and take your turn.

There's a significantly more likely scenario that this applies to: if there are no tiles in the center yet, and I really want to be first player next round, can I take the first player tile from the center by itself?

I would say no. The rules seem to indicate that it’s always taken along with other center tiles. And even if you can technically find a loophole in the syntax of the rules to get away with something like that, you need to step back and take a look at the larger intention of the rules. The Starting Player Marker is not a normal tile and doesn’t follow the acquisition/placement rules of normal tiles. It exists to be both a penalty and benefit torwards the first person to take colored tile(s) from the center.

And I would say, in the extremely rare case where no other tiles make it to the center, it stays put and starting player doesn’t change. Although it that ever occurs, go buy a Powerball ticket, or more likely, smack someone in the head for not shuffling the tiles.

My 2 cents.



Tema 298: Scoring rows and columns
Pregunta:
I'm a little confused about scoring rows and columns. If I manage to create a column of 3 tiles in a round during the tile placing phase how do I score it? Do I place and score the tiles one at a time so I score 1+2+3 or are they all placed and scored simultaneously so I score 3+3+3?

Respuesta 1:
You go row by row, when adding tiles to the pattern.

So let's say your pattern is currently empty, and you managed to fill out row 1, 2 and 3, with colors that are vertically adjacent on the pattern.

You'd move the tile from row 1 to its corresponding space, scoring 1 point.
Then move 1 tile from row 2 to its corresponding space right below the tile from row 1, scoring 2 points. Then move 1 tile from row 3 to its corresponding space right below the tile from row 2, scoring 3 points.
Total 6 points

Respuesta 2:
As you said, you "place and score the tiles one at a time". You always move the tiles from your left rows/lines to your wall and score from top to bottom. If you do this for each tile, 1 at a time, you will have better luck in getting an accurate count. Don't move everything at the same time and then try to determine your score. It's just too confusing that way and prone to errors.

Here are two quotes from the rules, with my highlight (they follow right together but here I am skipping over some language in between).



B. Wall-tiling

This phase can be carried out by all players simultaneously, as they move tiles from their complete pattern lines over to their walls.

A) Go through your pattern lines from top to bottom. Move the rightmost tile of each complete line to the space of the same color in the scoring line of your wall. Each time you move a tile, score points immediately(see scoring).

Scoring

Each tile you move over to your wall is always placed on the space matching its color and immediately scores as follows:

Tema 299: Do people really keep track of the discarded tiles in the lid?
Pregunta:
After scoring, we just pour everything into a plastic bowl and don't look at the tiles at all.

Is the game better if we keep looking at what is discarded and keep track?

It depends on how "seriously" you take it and your thoughts on hidden trackable information. Only way I'd track it is if I was playing for money. Which I wouldn't. So I don't. Play however- it's whatever the group you're with wants!

Respuesta 2:
It's not hard and it can be useful to at least have a rough idea of what colors have already come out a lot and which other colors are still going to come out a lot. But beyond that, we don't usually count exactly or anything like that.

I have a separate bag to put the discard in so when the standard draw bag is empty we can start using the other bag right away.

Respuesta 5:
Sure. Sometimes you need to if you are going for a particular bonus. I may not try to complete a certain color if it's impossible to get what I need.

Respuesta 6:
It's especially important in 2-player games, where you will very likely only see each tile once.

Respuesta 7:
I have individual little bowls that everyone puts discarded tiles in. I glance into them when I am particularly interested in a certain color.

Respuesta 8:
It's good to have a general overview of how many tiles per color are still left. No use in putting 4 reds in the last row only to realize next round there is no red tile left in the bag! ;-)

Especially in a 2 player game.

Respuesta 9:
My wife and I yesterday put the box off to the side as to not really track the tiles. Then I realized you can just do a quick count to figure our what is in the box. I. E. If you have a red in the middle and bottom row there are 6 reds in the box. The only thing this doesn't account for is floor tiles.

Tema 300: Missing all red tiles. Where to order spare/missing parts?
Pregunta:
Is there anywhere to order spare/missing tiles from plan b games?

I purchased a copy of the game from Amazon UK and am excited to try it out but am missing the 20 red tiles.

Respuesta 1:
May I ask why are you not returning the game to Amazon as not being fit for purpose?
Did the tiles not come bagged in separate colours, because this is a tell-tale sign of it being a counterfeit copy.
Anyway you can always purchase the "Azul - Collector's Tile Set 1" from the Next Games store.

Respuesta 2:
I have reached out to seller on amazon about swapping it for a new copy. Although it wasn't sold by Amazon, it was fufilled Amazon themselves.

Ideally that will be possible but if not it'll then be a case of trying to order the pieces.

The tiles all came individually bagged by colour. I read through the other thread on fakes and as far as I can tell mine seems fine. 4 Player boards, not 5, bag drawstring isn't fraying, factory tiles aligned correctly, insert and rules look to be of high quality ( no blurred text, or faults in design)

Tema 301: 5 players?
Pregunta:
My box came with 5 player boards, but the game only includes rules for 2-4. I'm thinking if I make 2 additional Factory Display boards, we can play with 5 players, since there are always leftover tiles in the bag after re-stocking the Factory each round.

I assume, and this is just a musing about the numbers without any math to back me up, that there'd be less mean-ness of forcing garbage tiles on other players and more mean-ness bourne of denial.

Respuesta 2:
Let's say on average you finish 2.5 rows per round per player, and you might have 4 in incomplete rows.

In a 4 player game that means by round 4, 56 of the 100 tiles are not in the bag (10+4 per player = 14*4 = 56), but you still have 44 to fill the 9 factory tiles (36 required).

Take that into a 5 player game and now you have 10+4 per player = 14*5 = 70 tiles not in the bag, and you have 30 tiles to fill 11 factory tiles, which means you only fill 7. Take it into round 5 and you fill even less factory tiles (12.5 + 4 per player = 16.5 x 5 = 82 not in the bag). It's very likely you're going to extend the game by several rounds, and in a worst case scenario, make it so the game might not be able to end.

It could work, but it could also get messy depending on what colors people are going for heavily. You could also end up in situation where it's impossible for people to complete their 5 rows if enough of a color is taken out of the game due to completed rows much easier in a 5 player game.

Give it a try and report back with your results on where you saw problems arise, if any, over the course of 10 or so games at 5 players.

Respuesta 3:
Thank you both. I've just discovered from another forum that it's possible my extra player board is a sign I received a counterfeit so I'll be looking into that before pulling it out to play again.
Also, I have added quite a few new games to my collection recently, so it might be a long time before I get back to you on this.

A possible solution to running out of tiles would be to add the rule that the final round is triggered when you cannot completely fill all the Factory Displays. That should also keep the game from running too long time-wise, which can often be a problem when adding a 5th or 6th player to games. Experimentation is needed to see if it's better to modify that to 2 or more that cannot be filled.

Edit: I'm returning my 5-board copy to Amazon.ca (they said they'll open an investigation) - I'm hoping the replacement I ordered is authentic, but that probably means it won't have a 5th board.

Respuesta 6:
Similar situation, but on TTS. We found that adding an extra 20-40 tiles made things easier, and we added two extra circles for the tiles for a total of 11. The big crunch was that it was easy to have 15-20 tiles left in the center split between only two colors. That can be devastating if you don't have your 5-row open for that color. Might have been too easy on ourselves, but we house ruled that the maximum number of tiles any player could take was 7. And when players took colors out of the center earlier, the problem didn't happen as much. Denial of tiles didn't seem to be as much of an issue.



Tema 302: Azul Review TL;DR pleasant and somewhat thinky filler
Pregunta:
This review was originally posted at https://www.awargamersneedfulthings.co.uk/2019/04/azul.html pop over there to see pictures from the review and my poor attempt at doing unboxing videos. the full text is below.

Overview
Azul probably needs no introduction. Since its release in 2017, it has proven to be one of those unicorn-games that has managed to cross over, from hobby games, into more mainstream gaming. Last Christmas my Sister, who is not a gamer and who I haven't seen in years (she lives in a different continent), called me up to talk about Azul which she had just played.

It is a competitive abstract game that is quick to teach and has a surprising amount of depth and it will give gamers and non-gamers alike plenty to chew on. It also looks beautiful on the table and if anything, plays too quickly, i.e. it is over before I want it to be over, two or three more rounds would always be welcome.

Gameplay
All players are building a mosaic on their own player board from a collective pool of tiles in the centre of the table. Available tiles all start in a number of 'factories' that are placed in between all players. You must take all tiles of the same pattern from a factory, any tiles that didn't match your pattern are discarded to the centre of the table to form a common pool of tiles.

You could just play this game concentrating on your own board, but the tile draw mechanism also allows you to jeopardise your opponent's best choices in a deliciously mean fashion. Of course, a casual gamer is probably not going to look for those 'take that' opportunities and will have a lovely time building their own mosaic on their own player board, albeit having to work through some unexpectedly tough decisions.

Those tough decisions, in all likelihood, have come from the experienced gamer or keen Azul-player at the table who may be looking for as many opportunities to minimise their opponents' choices.

This game rewards either play style, if not through an abundance of victories (I've not figured out a consistently good strategy) but in playing experience and fun. And after all, why do we play and obsess over these cardboard and plastic pieces whose intrinsic value is so little? I know for me, it's because of the experiences and fun that I have when playing with a friend or group of friends, the memories that are made and recalled...

When you've taken one pattern of tile from a factory or the centre, you place them on a pattern line, which has one to five spaces available. Tiles can only be placed on empty lines, or lines that have the same tile in already and empty spaces available. If you can't place them on a free pattern line, then they drop to the floor line. Any tiles on your floor line will cause negative points at the end of a round.

Any abstract game is always going to struggle with theme, but Azul probably has more of a theme than any abstract I've played. It's still fairly loose, but your actions and the overall look of the game reflect the process of building a mosaic work of art nicely.

Scoring happens after all tiles have been taken from the centre. It is simply a matter of taking a tile from a complete pattern line and placing it into your mosaic. When you do this you add up how many orthogonally contiguous tiles are touching it, and you count the placed tile in both the horizontal and vertical direction. If the placed tile is not adjacent to any other tile, it will score 1 point; if it is at the centre of a row and column then it will score a maximum of 10 points. (I have never managed this)

The end of the game is triggered when one person has one complete row. During my first game of this, my casual game group and I all raced to be the first to complete a row thinking that was a good thing. We did not appreciate that the end game scoring doesn't reward finishing the game. Players get far more bonus points from completing rows and using 5 tiles of the same colour in their mosaic. end thinking that was a good thing... However, after their 2nd and third consecutive plays of it, we were all a bit savvier and trying to score more points, over finishing the game.

This endgame condition balances the gameplay nicely. When you're in the lead, you're pushing to finish the game as quickly as possible, which will probably cause you to lose scoring opportunities making you lose points relative to the other players. If you're trailing, you are able to engineer, at least if there are three other savvy players around the table much harder tile draw decisions for the leading player whilst maximising your own score. The player interaction, despite all playing to their own board, is high.

Components
The tiles are glorious and the art, although simple geometric patterns are again, evocative of the theme. The box looks and feels fantastic and it comes with a well-though-out insert. Unfortunately, my player boards are bowed significantly which helps them to spin round like a record very easily.

Criticisms
A complete game is anywhere from five complete rounds to an average of six to eight rounds. For me, the game is over just a little too soon. I know this is normally the sign of a tight and balanced game and in general this a good thing. However, I find I am enjoying myself so much that I don't necessarily care that I may not be winning and just want to build a nicer pattern and have more turns in which to do so... I think I may be an artist at heart.

Conclusion
Azul is a heart-warming game, giving the feel as Patchwork and fully deserves its place as a modern 'classic', or at least, a soon-to-be modern classic. It is accessible for any type of gamer and although there's no direct conflict, there are certainly opportunities to mess with your opponents and it's this trait, being able to accommodate different play styles, that makes it appeal to any type of gamer. For me, it sits firmly in the filler category, taking about 40 minutes to play. I could see this easily becoming a firm family-favourite at holiday gatherings.

Tema 303: My unusual problem with Azul : a short review
Pregunta:
Hi,

I'm currently in the process of rating the games I own, which gave me the opportunity to think about the issue I have with Azul. I find it to be quite an unusual one among my collection, and so by posting this short review here I hope I can help some people make a more informed purchase.

A friend perfectly encapsulated my problem with Azul after our first game. There's a huge discrepancy between the visual aspect of the game and its underlying mechanics, he said.

I will try to expand on that now. Azul components are beautiful, there's no denying that. But behind this appealing product hides a very, VERY math-y game, that just isn't fun for me (and I'm a maths teacher !). The game is very abstract and to me it feels like a maths problem that was reskinned as azuleros decorations, but ultimately doesn't fool anyone.

Now I will concede that "fun" is a very subjective concept, and I'm sure that a lot of people enjoy playing Azul. Here's the weird part, though : I'm usually not against calculations and planification. Some of my best rated games contain a good deal of it. In Azul, though, it faces two problems.

First of all, the game is just too dry. It makes a world of difference to me when the calculations involve transforming resources to plant a forest to raise the oxygen level to raise the temperature to get a free ocean... versus taking this tile to get 4 points which means I get 3 more points from this next tile, and 7 points for the completed column.

But most importantly I find that in Azul, the course of events is too random for me to invest the energy in boring calculations ("he takes this - she takes this - i take this - etc etc ... so that means HE gets the 50 red tiles and not me"). More than once I have gotten screwed over, not by a perfidious alliance between my opponents to put me down, but instead a suboptimal move by them because they failed to count tiles or points correctly (and admitted so afterwards).

I am aware this sounds very whiny, and as a former poker player I've heard my fair share of lame excuses to the tune of "I only lost because you played badly. A good player would fold here" or whatever. But if you've studied a little bit of game theory, you know that in a game with more than 2 players, mistakes by an opponent are not guaranteed to help you. In fact, they may very well punish you, and it happens A LOT in Azul.

I will say though, it gets much better as a 2-player game, where the situation above doesn't apply (a mistake by your opponent is always going to profit you), which means putting the effort to calculate how the draft will unfold with precision gets more consistently rewarded.

Final rating for me : 6/10, as the average of the 5/10 I would give for 3 or 4 players, and 7/10 as a two-player game.

Respuesta 1:

Umm, ditto to you and the OP. What I find a bit odd is that I love maths and abstracts but can take or leave playing Azul. My wife has little interest in abstracts, is bored by maths but she loves Azul, can't play enough of it. I can't beat my 13 year old daughter in 2 or 3 player games, probably because she's smarter at it, but also like the OP I can't be bothered to think far enough ahead. Yep, always loosing sucks especially when you are Bob and never Charles.

I can definatly understand your point, and would never disagree with a well thought out rating like that.

I personally have played this game at all player counts and I love it. At 2 player I'd rate this very highly, as player count increases I feel the rating of this game drops pretty quickly.

I feel at 2 player, you can think and plan and have a good time going back and forth. As you get to 4 players, I feel like the majority of the game just turns into risk reduction and I find it not as fun, but that's just me.

I think what the OP is referring to is the amount of calculation needed to resolve e.g. if I take these and push these to the middle, place them here, then he takes those, pushes them to the middle and places them there and she takes those in the middle and puts them there, they'll score X and Y. I'll be left with those, but if I take those and ...etc, etc. You are correct the individual scoring calculation is simple, but evaluating the points to be gained from possible combinations for a number of moves ahead requires a lot of simple sums to made and stored in one's brain.

A game doesn't need to get you doing integral calculus to be mathy. I believe the OP means the amount o calculations you "have" to make (as simple as they are) in order to make the best out of every play.
OK, sure. But has anyone else seriously found this to be an issue? Ultimately, you are trying to fill your rows as anything left unfilled severely limits you in the next round. You cannot plan much beyond that as you don't know what tiles will fall in the next round. It takes mere moments to assess the quantity of each tile in the round and determine a plan that best gets them onto your board.

Let's be clear, this is a CASUAL game which makes it so popular among kids, families and gamers. There is much to consider, but it isn't frikken Chess.

From my perspective is not an issue at all. I don't think I ever said that, and I actually think it adds to the game.
When you look at Azul it looks a very casual game and it ends being a much more deeper game than it looks.

I think it's a great game. I just suck at it!
Agreed (though I can claim a fair share of wins)

It’s okay to have different opinions about games. I didn’t like Azul either. Life goes on regardless. Thank you for your review.



Tema 304: New to Azul - are there any rules issues that people get hung up on?
Pregunta:
It's not super hard to learn, but there's a couple of rules that people seem to get wrong (whether they misread the rules or maybe got taught incorrectly). On your turn you just pick all tiles of ONE colour from one location (ie: a factory tile or the centre of the table) and place all the tiles you just picked up on one line. The round isn't over until all the tiles are gone from the table.

Respuesta 1:
If you are an experienced rules reader and teacher, everything you need to know is in the rulebook laid out quite clearly IMO.

Having said that, a common issue to look out for is scoring. From top to bottom check the row on the left side, if it's complete bring over the rightmost tile to the scoring side and put it on the correspondingly colored space, then score that tile Scrabble style, i.e. if you connected to both an existing row and existing column of tiles then score each independently. Do this full process--move and score--for each left side row one at a time until you get to the bottom of your board. A common mistake is to move all the scoring tiles first then score.

Another rule to look out for is while drafting and placing tiles you can only put tiles on a single row on your turn. So if you only have 1 space available but draft 3 tiles you have to put the 2 extras on the floor row.

But you may have 2 rows the same color. You just have to have placed them in 2 (or more) separate turns.

But like I said these rules are all in the rulebook. I probably didn't explain them as clearly as the rulebook either.

Respuesta 2:
The end of round discarded tiles go in the box lid. They don't go in the bag until the bag is empty.

Respuesta 3:
The one thing I’ve seen new players not get right is the scoring based on how many tiles are adjacent vertically and horizontally. The common mistake is thinking the newly placed tile counts as 1 point always, when actually you score the vertical and horizontal separately. This means the newly placed tile “counts twice” if it has adjacencies both ways.

These two are also the ones I would point out. It is very intuitive to take a couple of tiles, and want to split them because you could complete multiple rows. But not allowed!

"The scoring is pretty obtuse. I’ve had … every person I’ve played it with for the first time get confused. All of them, every time."

But honestly I don't understand how so many people get confused with this one. It's quite simple really. As I said, we forgot to score rows and columns at round 2, but we weren't confused. We just forgot to score the rows and columns, but we remembered before it was too late, and then we had no issues going forward.
Hmm... I've always explained it as Scrabble-style scoring and most people I've taught it to caught on right away. Maybe Eric just isn't explaining it well?

Glad the game wasn't as daunting as feared. It does require a careful reading of the rules, but what game doesn't, right? Unlike many rulebooks, the rules are all there.

One thing we almost got tripped up on:

When you score a single tile, you get 1 point. When you score a row or column, you score however many tiles are in the row/column. At first we almost scored the individual, newly-placed tiles for that round as 1 point each, as if they were singles, then counted them again if they were in rows/columns. Of course that's incorrect, as you don't get the single point for the individual tiles if they are in rows/columns, you just count the rows/columns.
Just to make sure you don't play it incorrectly:
You should not score "however many tiles are in the row/column". You only score tiles or series of tiles if they are adjacent to the tile you just placed. As discussed above: Scrabble-style.


X O X - X
- X - - -
Placing a tile at O would score you 3 horizontally (because you create a series of 3 adjacent tiles) plus 2 vertically.
You don't score the last X in the same row.

But you may have 2 rows the same color. You just have to have placed them in 2 (or more) separate turns.

But like I said these rules are all in the rulebook. I probably didn't explain them as clearly as the rulebook either.
I thought I knew how to play this game but maybe I don't. In a given turn, I can pick up a color, say blue, and put them anywhere that's a legal play. If I wanted to could I not start 3 rows of all blue tiles?

X
XX
XXB
XXBB
XBBBB
BBBBB

That's a legal board right? And if I wanted, or was forced to, pick up a pair of blue tiles from another location I could place it on:
Row 1, putting one on floor.
Row 2, filling it completely
Row 3, filling it completely
Row 4, putting one on floor
None on row 5 obviously.

I hope my question is clear.

Your diagram has 6 rows, so it doesn't quite match your options. But yes, it seems from your wording that you've got the rules right. Tiles of the same colour can be in multiple rows and you can't add tiles to more than 1 row in any given turn.

If this is your starting position (assuming "X" is blank, and "B" is a Blue tile):

1st row      X
2nd row     XX
3rd row    XXB
4th row   XXBB
5th row  XBBBB
floor    BBBBB

Then, yes, you can take two Blue tiles on a single turn and do *one* of the following:

1) Place one on the 1st row, filling it completely, and dropping the second to the floor (giving you six blue tiles on your floor).
2) Place both on the 2nd row, filling it completely.
3) Place both on the 3rd row, filling it completely.
4) Place both on the 4th row, filling it completely.
5) Place one on the 5th row, filling it completely, and dropping the second to the floor (giving you six blue tiles on your floor).

One scenario of many is: They took one too many blue from the center, took too many white but it helped give them more points than they lost, and was forced at the end of the round to take the last remaining yellow.

Different colors from different turns. You understand that pieces accumulate there until the end of the round and are only removed during scoring, right?



Tema 305: My Little Azul - Baby Blue variant
Pregunta:
My four year old has a couple of kids games, but he prefers to "help" me play my solo games or try and play against me in some of the non-solo games. So I usually have to quickly come up with some way that we can move the pieces around that resemble an actual game.

He really wanted to try Azul the other night so we played a simplified version. I taught him the basic rule that you have to take all of the matching tiles from one area, but instead of placing them in the rows on the left side of the player board, I had us place them directly onto a matching spot of the wall.

If you can't place them on your wall because those tiles are already filled in, it goes on the bottom, which is the "Bad Tile Row."

First player to completely fill in their wall wins, but you can also deduct one point for each tile in the Bad Tile Row, so finish the round to see who gets stuck with more tiles leftover. If you fill up the Bad Tile Row before you fill in your player area, you lose.

No first player tile, just take turns going first each round.

Very simple and quick. Should last three rounds. I think his favorite part is taking the tiles out of the bag and filling up the circles anyway.

Tema 307: A Word of Warning about Flying With Azul

I took Azul with me in my carry on when flying. The bag of tiles triggered a search from TSA. I find this ceaselessly amusing.

As a (very) frequent flier, I would caution against drawing any conclusions based on one experience with TSA screening.

They are looking at your bag for a few seconds in most cases. What they see varies based on how the items are sitting in your bag at that moment, and of course it's a bit subjective.

I doubt there is anything specific about Azul that made them flag it. Under the right circumstances, from the right angle, anything can look a little confusing and trigger a bag search.

I guess reasonably dense stacks of cards beyond the Standard 52 deck seem like awfully suspicious black blocks to X-Rays. I've had no issues with bakelite pieces or dice previously, but none of those that I've travelled with are as big as Azul's bag of tiles!

I've learned to just take out my boardgames and stick them in a separate bin, just like a laptop or tablet. TSA's pretty understanding, when I say "This thing always gets flagged, so I'm just going to take it out now to make things easier."

Tema 308: 3 Play Impressions: Azul, a beautiful game that can be quite mean
Pregunta:
Hi there! Welcome to my impressions posts that I'm calling 3 Play Impressions. I love board games and would like to share my opinions. All games I share impressions on will have been played at least 3 times to have a solid grasp of the game fundamentals.

Today is Azul a beautiful abstract tile game using colorful tiles to create stained glass, but be careful or you might end up "breaking" a bunch!

Time to Set-Up: 5 minutes
Time to Play: 30-60 minutes
Components: 8/10
Rules Weight: 1.5
Strategic Weight: 2.5
Player Interaction: High
Replayability: 10/10
Fun Had: 8.5/10

Components

While the tiles are beautiful to look at and they feel quite nice, I would have gladly paid for a player board that is thicker to keep the scoring track marker from moving around so easily, same with the tiles. My biggest complaint with this game is how much the tiles and scoring markers can move with a moderate bump on the table. There are third-party board enhancements that help with this though, if it's an issue for you.

Set-Up and Rules

Azul is very quick to set up even as one player, the hardest thing to remember is how many "markets" to put out per player count. A single person can set this up within 5 minutes or less, and adding help would only encumber the setting up process.

The rules are quite simple to grasp. Players will take turns taking tiles from the market and placing them strategically onto their board, with this happening until all of the tiles are gone, in which scoring occurs. There is more involved into this, but that is the gist of it. I have seen players have slight confusion at first, but overall the game is picked up quite quickly.

As such, teaching is very simple, I have taught friends in less than 5 minutes and they have been competitive in their first game.

Strategy

The strategic depth of Azul comes from balancing tile taking for your benefit, while also considering ways to force your opponents to take tiles that will cause them to lose points. Azul is a drafting set collection game with perfect information and players certainly need to be aware of how their choices will affect the other players boards.

I have played Azul over 10 times, mostly at 2 players, and have mostly played it casually and it plays phenomenally as a lightweight casual game. With that said, I certainly see that this game can provide some moderately tough choices for players looking to play more competitively.

Interaction

Azul can be a mean game due to drafting from a shared market. Actions must be balanced between scoring points on your own board versus causing your opponent to lose points. There will be times that a player will take an intentional point loss to force an opponent to take a bigger loss. The only time choices felt like multiplayer solitaire were at the beginning when everyone has fresh boards, as the game progresses it becomes necessary to focus on every player's board as much as your own.

Why is it Fun?

With a quick set-up it's never a drag to take Azul out, and the quick playtime with high interactivity makes it a good time investment. Most games at 2p have finished in 30-45 minutes for me, though 4 player games have pushed an hour. It's a game that doesn't need to be taken too seriously, but those looking for that experience can easily make this into a more competitive game. Furthermore it's highly accessible to those not in the board game hobby.

Conclusion

Azul took the board game world by storm last year, winning many awards and being featured on many mainstream publications - rightfully so. It's not a perfect game by any means, but it is well worth the praise and one that I intend on upgrading to take care of my component gripes. Azul is currently hovering in the $25 range on Amazon, and that's a fantastic price for anyone interested in this game.

Having played it with 2 as well as 4 players, I find that the game is less mean with more players. This is because causing your opponent to lose points in a 2-player game is the same as gaining those points yourself. However in a 3 or 4 player game, causing 1 player to lose points does not help you lift yourself above the other players. So you are looking more at gaining points.

It is also much easier to force your opponent to take points onto their floor line in a 2-player game than a 4-player, unless you happen to be the 2nd last person to pick up tiles in a particular round.

I played my first game last weekend with my girlfriend, and while we mostly just concentrated on what we needed ourselves, and didn't play particularly "aggressive", both of us took some tiles the other needed at least once in the game. Neither of us considered it "mean".
I think actively looking at ways to make your opponent lose points is "mean" in a gaming sense. In your example, neither you or your girlfriend were making moves to purposefully hurt the others score, even if that sometimes did happen.

Alternately, you might notice on your last turn of the round that while there are two types of tiles available to you, one giving you more points than the other, your opponent can only use one of them, so you take that color, forcing them to put the remaining tiles on the floor. You didn't have to do that. You even got less points than you would have had you picked the other color of tiles. However, you slowed your opponent down and gave them negative points. It's playing the game as designed, but it's also somewhat mean.

That seems a pretty watered-down generalized notion of "mean", if simply making what you believe to be a good move which maximizes your chances of winning is "mean".

If I get less points but cost you enough points, then I have improved my position. The goal is to finish with more points than your opponent, not to maximize your own points. Our final absolute scores have no meaning; only the difference in our scores matters. Gaining me 2 points and costing you 2 points is no more "mean" than gaining me 4 points, or gaining me 8 points and giving you 4 points.


E.g. for a different example, consider the abstract strategy game  . Players take turns placing stones on empty hexes, and you win by connecting the two opposite board sides which have your color. You could think in terms of trying to "help" yourself and make your connection, or you could think in terms of trying to be "mean" and "hurt" your opponent and block their connection. But the difference is an illusion: they're equivalent, just two sides of the same coin. If you successfully connect your sides, then you've simultaneously blocked your opponent; and if you successfully block your opponent, then you've simultaneously connected your sides.

I think that you're using "pleasant" and "mean" in a confusing way. "Mean" normally implies badness and malice, especially when you contrast it with "pleasant".

While playing a competitive game, it's perfectly normal and expected that all your moves are harmful, not beneficial, to your opponents... and that is pleasant, because playing the game is pleasant for the players.

Why would a competent player trying to win the game ever intentionally make a move "beneficial to others" in a competitive game? (Unless e.g. it's a teaching game and you're helping a newbie, or helping your child, or something like that.)

---

Consider that in a 2-player game of Azul, we could equivalently use a single score track, with 0 in the middle instead of at one end, and a single marker which only shows the difference between our scores. Every time I gain points or you lose points (in terms of standard Azul scoring), we move the marker right, and every time I lose points or you gain points, we move the marker left. If the marker moves right, it's purely subjective whether you want to consider that I just did something "mean" or not. "Costing you 2 points" is the same effect as "gaining me 2 points": the marker moves 2 spaces in my favor either way. All that really matters in the end is whether the marker ends up on my side or your side.

Consider again the game  : every move you make can simultaneously be viewed as "mean" (trying to block the opponent from making a connection) or "not mean" (trying to make your own connection). There's literally no way to objectively distinguish them - they are equivalent.

Yes, but we're talking about playing a board game here. It should be a watered down definition.

If you opponent feels like you are spending more time attempting to sabotage their gameplay rather than just improve your own, it is going to feel mean to them. Even if it's just a good move or strategy!

Take two player Arboretum. I have had games where due to luck of the draw, I could have prevented my opponent from scoring at all, and having a lock on at least one good path of trees, I would have guaranteed my win even if I didn't score another path. However, I could also win by letting them score and making sure I score at least another path. Shutting them out completely feels mean.

As far as Azul, there's more to the game than just points to consider. There's the availability of pattern lines. If I can take tiles that will just give me a couple points, but means my opponent cannot finish a pattern line and will have to put tiles on the floor, that might be a better move than one that will give the both of us points, but widen the point gap between us in my favor simply because it limits my opponents options in the next round. Which can be good strategy, but, due to sabotaging my opponent's productivity, it's a bit mean.

EDIT: And when your primary gaming partner is your wife, you don't want her to feel like you are being mean to her!

I enjoy it a lot.

Respuesta 3:
Besides the random setup for each round there is also quite a bit of interaction ongoing once you have a few games under your belt. Then you start looking not just for the tiles that benefit you the most but also for leaving tough choices for the next player(s). Due to those two points I cam see myself not getting tired of Azul for the foreseeable future.

Respuesta 4:
See a game like Sagrada has very little player interaction so it’s highly dependent on variability in setup and events and random input. A game like Azul has lots of player interaction so replayability depends on the players. For some that’s a bad thing but for others this means there is endless replayability.

We gave the blank side a try our 2nd game, and found it to be much more interesting, as it requires you to plan your moves.



Tema 310: Multiple incomplete rows of the same color
Pregunta:
If you have a row started but not finished on the left hand side of the board when you take tiles of that incomplete row color are those tiles required to go into the incomplete row or can you start a new row with that color?

For example you have two tiles in the bottom 5 space row that are red. You draft 4 red tiles from the center. Can you put those 4 tiles in the 4 space row or are you required to finish the 5 space row and drop one tile on the floor? We’ve always played that you have to finish a row before starting another row of the same color but now we can’t actually find that rule. What’s correct?

Respuesta 1:
You can have as many incomplete rows of the one colour that you like. But it is a losing strategy.

But in your scenario, it would make sense to fill the 4 row.

There is no such rule that compels you to do this. You are therefore able to develop more than one row of the same colour. Remember though, that you cannot add tiles to more than one row during a turn.

Tema 311: Upcoming sequel to Azul
Pregunta:
Hi,

this weekend I attended a board game convention in my home town of Bremen, where Michael Kiesling demoed prototypes of 2 sequels to Azul. I was able to try one of them. I believe its current title is Azul - Palaces of Portugal. Please keep in mind this was a prototype, so things are likely going to change.
Here, instead of tiles we were drafting palaces / towers of different heights (1-4). Instead of randomly drawing these from a bag, the game comes with several manufacturing plates. These plates determine which 4 palaces (height & color) to place on them. At the beginning of each round a new set of 5,7 or 9 (depending on the player count) is randomly drawn.
The drafting works pretty much the same as in the previous versions of Azul.
The player boards also look very similar to the original Azul, where you have a top row with one spot and then 4 more rows, each having one additional spot. To be eligible to place a palace on your board you have to fill up the entire row. Next to the rows you then have your 5x5 grid, however since there are only 4 colors every row and column has a duplicate color. The field in the middle of the grid is a joker and allows you to place a palace of any color.
There is an additional restriction in this version of Azul, which is that only one palace of a specific height may be duplicated within a row or column. For example: if I have two palaces of height 3 in a row, every other palace in that row must be of a different height, i.e.: 1, 2 and 4. So, I may not have two palaces of height 3 and two palaces of height 4 in the same row or column.
When scoring, players get points according to a palace’s height. Thus, a palace of height 1 scores one point and a palace of height 4 scores four points. Negative points are also deducted based on the height of a palace and not based on the number of palaces that were ‘dropped to the floor’.
In addition to scoring the palace that was just placed, players also score any orthogonally adjacent palaces, provided they are lower than the palace just placed. For example, if I place a palace of height 3 and the palace above is height 2, while the palace to the left is height 3, I only score the palace I just placed and the palace of height 2. Therefore 5 points in total. It is also important to note that only the neighboring palaces are scored, unlike Azul, where you would also score an entire chain of tiles when placing a new tile.
The game ends after 5 rounds.
Endgame scoring works like this: for completed rows you may score the height of one palace if it is the first row, the height of up to two palaces if it is the second row, three if it is the third and so on.
You may score all palaces for completed columns and completed colors (which I believe requires 7 palaces of the same color).

My Thoughts
I found this to be a couple of steps up in terms of complexity from the original Azul. The rules are easy enough to explain and understand, especially of everybody is already familiar with Azul. But the gameplay is much more puzzely (if that is a word…). Not only do you have to keep in mind the new placement restrictions, you also must plan ahead a lot more when trying to optimize scoring for future turns and weigh short term versus long term gains. If you try to optimize too much by building from smaller to higher palaces to scoring more points, you have to be mindful of what your opponents are doing. Especially in a 4-player game it is possible to run out of height 4 palaces in the last rounds of the game, which could make it impossible for you to complete a row or column.
Also, there is a bit of an issue with the restriction to only have one height duplicated in a row or column. This is easy enough to miss by oneself and the other players. And tricky to correct when noticing in a later round. I am sure that there is a rule to deal with this, but that was not explained to us. It actually happened to me. Since we could not recall which palaces I had drafted that round, we decided to smash the palace I had placed last and also deducting the placement bonus. Gave me a total of negative 8 points to what I had scored. I thought that felt fair. But I am a bit worried that this might happen occasionally, and it might be perceived as an issue. Michael Kiesling looked a bit worried when he noticed this. So, maybe he will address this in some fashion in the final version of the game.
Over all I really enjoyed my play of Azul – Palaces of Portugal. It is more of a gamer’s game I think, and I would recommend it for players who, like me, love Azul’s drafting and are looking for more of a challenge. However, I do not think that this is still a game I could play with virtually anybody. Unlike Azul, which I can play with my wife and in-laws, just as well as with my gaming friends. I would argue that this is more of a ‘Kenner-Spiel’ and a little less family friendly.

This post has gotten a lot longer than I intended. I apologize for that. I still hope people will find it interesting.

Hi,

unfortunately I have not played Sintra yet, so I cannot properly compare the two games. From the videos I have seen about Sintra, my impression is that this version is still a step up from it. But take that with a grain of salt, since this is purely based on my impression without having played sintra yet.
Maybe some other user was at the Bremer Spieletage as well, had a chance to play both versions and give his/her impression.

Thanks for the info. From what I can tell this seems to be not that Azul-ish anymore. Sintra is absolutely worthy of the name, but this sounds like quite a different game.

Respuesta 4:
Hi,

It does still have that core drafting mechanism and board that you place your pieces on. And you still try to optimise your turns for placement bonuses. So there still is a lot of familiarity. But it is a good deal more thinky when compared to the original Azul.

Respuesta 6:
Unfortunately I forgot my mobile phone and was not able to take any pictures.

Michael Kiesling also demoed a second prototype for another Azul sequel. Which I believe is further in terms of development than Palaces of Portugal. Unfortunately I cannot recall that sequel's name. I was also not able to try it, but from what I could see and gather it appears that players build rose windows. There are several (mono?)-coloured rose windows on the player boards. Every rose consists of numbered diamond shapes. The players draft diamond shaped pieces. In order to place a piece in position 1 of a window they need to collect one piece of that color, for position 5 they need to collect five pieces of that color, etc...
Every round a random color is determined to be a joker and pieces of that color can be used to replace any other color.
There was also something about bonus fields that players could activate under certain cirucmstances but that I cannot quite recall how that worked.
It looked very intriguing though and I regret that I did not have the opportunity to try this version as well.
Please take everything I say about this other sequel with a grain of salt. As I said, I was not able to try it myself and I did not get a full explanation either.
Best regards

Sebastian

Respuesta 7:
I am also from Bremen and managed to try the other sequel during the Spieletage. The other sequel is called Hall of fame and I liked it a lot. Azul itself was a quite boring experience for me I always thought that the tile placement was not creative or thinky enough. Azul-Hall of fame does fill this gap. The placement of tiles is exactly as you said. The bonus fields work as such that whenever you surround the bonus field completely you are allowed to draw additional tiles from another bonus cardboard. How many depends on the type of bonus field. There are "draw 1" "draw 2" "draw 3"... furthermore you usually complete the "roses" in the mosaic with one and the same colour. In the middle you try to complete them with one colour each.

Great sequel! I like most in the series, but did not have the chance to play palaces of Portugal yet.

Tema 313: Azul Review - Try Some Tactictal Tiling
Pregunta:
This is taken from my blog Playing Games Together: https://playinggamestogether.wordpress.com. Have a look for more like this, or to see the review with pictures!


The name of this game comes from the main thematic inspiration of the game, azulejos, the Spanish word for tiles. The initial attraction to the game for most is the art style used. Even the box is beautifully decorated with colourful patterns inspired by classic decorative tiles reminiscent of the Alhambra in Southern Spain. Once you open the box, the components of the game all follow this theme, and really are a pleasure to look at.

The main pieces used in the game are the tiles. These have 5 different patterns and are a similar size to Scrabble tiles, but a bit thicker. They come in a cloth bag to reproduce that classic Scrabble feel when delving into it to retrieve more. There is actually another small similarity to Scrabble in the scoring, which I will explain later. There is a very loose story to give an excuse for what you are doing in the game (you have been commissioned to decorate a royal palace in Portugal), but that really is of minimal importance to the gameplay.

So, what do you actually do in the game? Well, the main aim is to fill a 5*5 square with beautiful tiles, and do so in a way that scores the most points. This is achieved over several rounds (at least 5) and each round consists of two phases: Drafting and Placing/scoring.

The first job is to try and fill up the left side of the board by drafting/selecting tiles from the 'factory displays' in the middle of the table. This sounds simple enough, but due to some restrictions, you may be forced to take too many tiles, and any you can't place on the board 'smash on the floor', giving you negative points!

If you complete any rows in the drafting stage, you can then add one tile of that colour to the main 'wall' and score points. Here's where the other Scrabble similarity comes in - you score one point for each tile in the same row that joins the new one, plus one point for each joining tile in the column, including the new tile both times. This way, the more tiles you already have on the board (and how well you placed them), the better your score, so the points obtained each round are higher and higher.

As you progress with each round the restriction that you can't place the same colour tile twice in the same row or column forces you to think more carefully about your tactics, and also makes you more likely to drop tiles.

The game ends when one player has completed at least one row of tiles. At the end there are various bonus points available for every completed row or column, or for getting five of the same colour on the board. These can definitely change the outcome, so are worth going for.

I got Azul as a gift for my wife, as something that we could play together that wasn't more aimed at a younger audience. We both really like it, I think it works really well as a 2 player game, although you can have up to 4 players. It has a great learning curve while playing. During our first 5-10 games we both found and employed different tactics that increased our score since the last game. This feeling of progression and discovery of tactics is very satisfying and is what makes me keep coming back. We mostly play to try and get the highest score on our own boards, but due to the drafting mechanic you can absolutely aim to sabotage the other player and stop them collecting sets, if you like that kind of thing.

Overall, I would recommend Azul to anyone who enjoys thinking games, Scrabble (but without the words), colourful components and especially those of you who love tiling and have been looking for a way to make a game of it!

Tema 315: 100 points is possible how?
Pregunta:
New to the game and have only played a few times, but I'm wondering how it would be possible to score anywhere near 100 points if you're only playing until one person has completed a row of 5? AS I said, we're new at it, but our scores so far have only hovered around the 20-30 point mark. I just don't see how you could play that many tiles without someone getting 5 in a row.

Thanks in advance!

**EDIT: YES I HAVE READ AND UNDERSTOOD THE RULES AND AM AWARE THE TILE PLACEMENT AND SCORING ONLY HAPPENS AT THE END OF EACH ROUND, THANKS**

**EDIT #2: I guess I jumped the gun by posting this after only a couple games under my belt; I definitely feel I have a better grasp now on both how to score more, and why the game would go longer. Thanks to everyone who contributed to this thread, especially those who did so in a constructive and non-snarky way! I enjoyed reading everyone's different strategies, it has already improved my play.

Respuesta 1:
Sounds like you're getting a rule wrong. You know that you only move tiles across into your wall at the end of each complete round (when all tiles have been taken), right? So it takes a minimum of five rounds for the game to end, which is plenty of time to score that many points.

Respuesta 2:
Planning which tile you're going to place to maximize adjacency is the key to higher scores. Also, it is entirely possible (happens frequently to us when we play) that folks will hold off placing tiles that would complete a horizontal row in order to give themselves more time to complete vertical rows (7 bonus points) and/or collect colored sets (all five tiles of a specific color gains 10 bonus points).

Yes. It's very possible to score 100+.

Respuesta 3:
It's possible but not probable. I've seen it twice in about 30 games, both times it was my mother who basically had 4-5 tiles in every row but the last, 2-3 columns, 2-3 color bonuses. It was disgusting, and I still don't know how she did it, especially since one was a 2-player game!

Firstly, the game isn't a race to complete a row of 5. Secondly, please read through the rules again and make sure you're playing and scoring correctly. Despite Azul rules being pretty straight-forward, folk seem to keep tripping up on them.

Respuesta 5:
It's actually possible through just the tile placement. You can can place 20 tiles before triggering game end with your 21st tile (which means an average of 5 points per placement...assuming no negatives). The end game bonuses are what actually allow some people to score 100 points. Personally I've never seen it happen.

Of course, I'm likely to rush to get 5 in a row early so that we can move on to a deeper game! I don't think I'll ever see 100 points in Azul.

Respuesta 6:
You could place all 25 if you added one to each row in the final round

Respuesta 7:
In all of our games, I scored 101 points once. We have gotten into the 80s a few times, and the 90s once or twice, but my 101 points is king in our house.

How I did it? Just normal play. I was able to get a lot of tiles in lines out for good scoring, and had a couple column and same color bonuses.

I consider it my greatest achievement in gaming. I think.

Yes, we are playing and scoring correctly. According to my rulebook, the game ends when one player completes a horizontal row. As far as it being a "race", sure, one player could try to draw it out to make it more complex and score more, but if the other doesn't want to play that way, I don't see how you could stop them. This is why I posted the thread... to get an idea how not to have the game be a race to get 5 across.

Respuesta 14:
Husband & I play 2 players most frequently, player count will make a difference. His personal best is 112 points, mine is 108 points. (Scores are from two different game sessions). And have quite a few scores in the low to mid 90's. Definitely possible. Easier to accomplish in lower player counts, because you both need an agreement to not end the game yet. Ending the game becomes harder to avoid in larger groups, and is harder to track other opponents on what they want/need to avoid to accomplish certain things. Much easier when you only have 1 opponent, and can clearly see they only need this specific tile to complete the row.

In our games, we could have ended the game way earlier than 100+ points. But the leader player wants to get as many as possible, and the following player wants a chance to catch up. Hence the working together to not end the game, they usually end when one player has no other choice. Ending the game when you already know you're going to lose is a bit silly, but continuing to play may also be considered 'drawing out the inevitable defeat', but you also might get lucky, between the 5 same tiles & vertical column scorings, and potentially pushing enough negative tiles onto your opponent.

Also (edit): If you are playing just to win, then getting 5 in a row first will trigger the end game (and extremely easy to do with the top row), but you are likely to lose to the other players who are building up combos and scoring more points with their larger culminative points each round.
Playing to accomplish a max scores, to beat your last/top score, all gives the game a different dynamic & deeper strategy. But depends on the players.

If they are only trying to build 5 across quickly you should be looking to build next to each other for more points each round, or a column, or 5 colors to get extra end game points. Someone focusing on just the first row in my experience typically doesn't win against someone actively looking to build next to other pieces and aim for end game points.

Respuesta 16:
The first thing I would say is you are right 100 points takes some work to get to. I’m not sure it’s likely in a 5 round game, but I would also say 20-30 points in a 5 round game sounds low. Assuming you are placing 3-4 tiles per round that is roughly 17 points at minimum if you don’t take advantage of any scoring rules. I guess I’m not really answering your question anymore, but often times it isn’t in a players best interest to end the game in 5 rounds so even hate drafting tiles to extend the game can be a good strategy to allow yourself for larger tile placement scores and more end game bonuses.

No. to get the top row, just requires being able to pick up one of each different colour in consecutive rounds. A column requires to be able to get a set of 5, as set of 4 etc, which is harder & may often not be possible due to tile distribution. However, it is possible to get a column in 2 or 3 rounds as multiple rows can be completed together.

Good point. Any column is going to take a bit of luck to fill out the bottom couple of tiles, as there could be a situation where not enough of the tile you need are even out. Whereas the top row is almost always going to be fillable in 5 rounds.

Still 5 rounds is a long time for an opponent to accumulate points to render the go for the top row strategy unreliable as a winner.

Then I suggest in your next game that one player (you), forgets about racing to complete a row and instead adopts a strategy to get the most points out of your tile placement (e.g. working towards clumps of tiles and columns). When after 5 rounds the game has ended, you will notice that the person who triggered the end will have lost.

If people persist in racing to complete a row and therefore always losing, that probably suggests that either they don't care about playing better or they just don't enjoy Azul. Either way, your points totals will always remain low.

Good luck.

As an example, we just finished a 6 round 4 person game where I scored 96 points. I was scoring roughly 10 points a round on average. At the end of the game I had 1 row, 2 columns, and filled in all the reds, which totals 26 points alone.

Respuesta 24:
Our highest 3P game has been 120, 117, 96. Guess Mrs 96 hadn't realised she wouldn't win, whilst the other 2 of us were in a shoot out deliberately not completing a row, each in the belief that we would ultimately win. Yes, it was a family game and we weren't being super analitical.

Michael Kiesling is a very intriguing game designer responsible for many of the best games I have played over the years, Coal Baron and Maharaja amongst them. His latest game, AZUL, is an award winning abstract, tile laying, pattern matching game available from NEXT MOVE/PLAN B and PEGASUS Spiele and it gained the Kritikpreiss for 2018.

It is a beautifully colourful game with wonderful shiny, smooth plastic tiles and heavy card Factories, and the quality of the card used for the Factories and for the player's boards is strong and unlikely to bend though you may need to manipulate them slightly to be able to lay them completely flat. The artwork by Philippe Guérin & Chris Quilliams is crisp and detailed and epitomises the ancient Portuguese/Moor decor that the game takes its name from. It has a specific job to do in the game and it does it specifically.



There are five sets of coloured tiles, Blue, Red, Patterned Black, Patterned Light Blue and Patterned Yellow, that represent the ceramic tiles of the Alhambra Palace viewed by King Manuel I of Portugal who brought the style back home with him. I can understand why some of the tiles are patterned - colour blind players need some guidance - but just why the Blue and Red tiles have no patterning I haven't figured out yet as both of these colours can confuse some sufferers.

The game is one of luck mixed with strategy and skill. It is played out on one or the other side of the player boards - one side has a 5x5 coloured grid, the other has a 5x5 blank grid - each player using the same side naturally. Whichever side is used the rules for the game remain the same, the difference being that tiles moved across from the Pattern Lines can be placed in any of the available spaces instead of only on the space of their colour.



The circular Factories are from where players draw their tiles; the number of Factories depends on the number of players. All tiles are placed in the nice 'AZUL' drawstring bag and mixed thoroughly before being drawn and placed four at a time onto the Factory Displays, the same number on each.

The Factories are placed in a circle leaving a large enough space in the centre to allow discarded tiles to be placed there and so that they can be clearly seen by all players.

On their turn, players take all the tiles of one colour from any one of the Factories or from the central space, placing (or leaving) the other tiles on the Factory into the centre, leaving the Factory empty. The game is played the same all the way through, players taking tiles and placing them on their loading bays, one colour of tile per line, and continues until one player has completed a full horizontal line of five tiles, a minimum of five Rounds at least, when the game ends.



Players can screw themselves by placing tiles on their loading bays of a type that they already have one of on the coloured (or blank - reverse side of player boards) grid; there can only be one of each type of tile in a row whether you are playing the coloured or blank board (aka the Wall). If you are forced to take tiles that could put you in this situation you may place them in the negative scoring rack (aka the 'floor' line) at the base of their boards.

There are some neat rules, such as you must take all the tiles of one colour and you must be able to lay them either in one of your loading bay (aka Pattern Lines) space or/and onto the Floor track. Players must also be careful of the tiles they place in the central area because it is easy to take the tiles you require and leave a 4 or 5 tile run for an opponent to collect from the centre. The rules allow you to have different Pattern lines containing the same colour tiles, eg. 2 lines of Blue tiles, as long as only tiles of one colour are in the same line.

There are decisions to make each turn but little options, you either take the tiles from a Factory or from the centre. There is a scoring at the end of each round, tiles scoring for being solo or adjacent to others on the Wall. Prior to scoring, the rightmost tiles on complete Pattern lines are moved over to the Wall onto tile spaces of the same colour. The remaining tiles on the Pattern line are removed from the game for this round. Tiles on incomplete Pattern lines remain in place for the next Round. It is all so simple, mechanic-wise, that you can learn the rules in less than 5 minutes. I can honestly say that this is one of the first, if not the first, game where for the first time of playing I have opened the box, read the rules and then played to the end and still finished within the 30-45 minute time frame, actually within the 30 minutes - our first game was with 3 players and from opening the box to ending the game took 26 minutes.

This is a lovely looking game. It plays very well and is a lot of fun. I can see why it is well liked because it is an interesting filler game for between more tactical/strategic games when you are having a 5+ hour game session or are at a games event or convention. It is easy to learn and subsequently easy to teach. There is a modicum of skill required when collecting tiles, such as keeping in mind that there are bonus points for completing horizontal and vertical lines, these being parts of any strategies you can try, but there is no other actual player interaction.

In 2018 it was voted 'Spiel des Jahres' ahead of Luxor by Rüdiger Dorn for Queen Games and The Mind by Wolfgang Warsch for Nürnberger-Spielkarten-Verlag. Being voted for such a prestidgious will add to its popularity and at a cost of between €20.00 - €35.00. Either way it is a very good price and very good value.

Dominion, Tikal, and some others, too. But this was pre-2011, when the "Kennerspiel des Jahres" award was introduced. Since then, "Spiel des Jahres" is for lighter games only. Keep in mind that the target audience of these prizes is the whole society and not geeks like us.

Tema 317: Running out of tiles before full row?
Pregunta:
I've played three games with two players each time. Two players means there's five factories out.

You always place four tiles per factory regardless of player count.

Since you only do the wall-tiling phase after the factory-offer phase, which only ends when all the tiles are selected, there's only a chance to place a single tile per row per round.

There's 100 tiles in the game. In a two player game you're placing 20 tiles out (5 factories, 4 tiles) per round. That's exactly 5 rounds. If both players miss a row a single time there aren't any tiles left for a sixth round! It hasn't happened yet but it does seem possible.


I'm more confused about when you use more factories with more players. If you are using seven factories you only get 3 full rounds and a round with only some tiles left over... That's only four chances to put tiles in a row!


I've looked up video guides of how to play and they all seem to agree that you only get to do wall-tiling after all the tiles in the factory select phase are used up. The rules even say "in the unlikely event" that you run out of tiles before the end of the game. But with more players and more factories it seems basically guaranteed you'll run out of tiles?


So, when you totally run out of tiles for a round, do you recycle the community discard pile and keep playing? Or does the game end?

Respuesta 1:
You recycle the discards and keep playing until ALL tiles are used/chosen.

Respuesta 2:
You recycle the communal discards when the bag is empty.

At the start of the round when you prepare the factories (palce 4 tiles on each factory), if there are not enough tiles in the bag you place as much as you can, then refill the bag with all tiles from the discard and place the remaining tiles from the bag.

Respuesta 4:
It sounds to me like you're playing something wrong. The parts of your post that make me think that are

and

Quote:
In a two player game you're placing 20 tiles out (5 factories, 4 tiles) per round. That's exactly 5 rounds.
1) You choose all the tiles of one color from a factory. If there is only one factory with blue tiles, it has two blue tiles, and you want blue, you have to pick both of them.

2) When you select tiles from a factory, ALL the rest of the tiles on that factory get moved into the center with the 1st player token, and from that point on you can choose a color from all the tiles in the center. So if there are 5x red tiles in the center and you want to pick red, you have to pick all of them.

3) The number of rounds and tiles chosen will be highly dependent on choices in #1 and #2, it will definitely NOT always be 5 rounds.

@rules
C. Preparing the next round
If nobody has completed a horizontal line of 5 consecutive tiles
on her wall yet (see End of the game), prepare the next round.
The player with the starting player marker refills each of the
Factory displays with 4 tiles from the bag as in the setup. If the
bag is empty, refill it with all the tiles that you have placed in
the lid of the game box and then continue filling the remaining
Factory displays. Then, start the new round.

Respuesta 6:
Just a side note:

At most, each player can have 10 tiles on their player board between rounds, assuming each row is 1 tile short of being completed.

Assuming everyone completed 5 rows, you'd have at most 15 tiles on each player board at the end of the next round.

It's going to be a rare situation that you run out of tiles. We've played the game 70 times and never run out of tiles.

We had that happen just tonight! In the last round of a 4p game, the ninth factory only had three tiles on it: no tiles left in the bag, no tiles in the lid of the box. I had to check the rulebook to see what to do, and, yep, it acknowledges the rarity of the situation but does say you just play with as many tiles as are available. First time in 15 games that had happened.

Respuesta 12:
Today it happened to us, 4 player and we had not enough tiles to fill all the factories. We were missing 5 tiles, so we had 7 factories with 4 tiles, 1 factory with 3 and the ninth factory empty. I was wondering if that placing of tiles was correct. We could have put 4 tiles on 4 factories and 3 tiles on the other 5 factories. I checked the manual (in Italian), but no hint there. Did anyone had the same (rare) situation? How did you solve it?

In the qualifieres of the German Board Game Championships 2019 we solved this issue the same way you did:

Fill as many factories with 4 tiles as possible. Remaining tiles are put onto one factory.

Tema 318: MeepleGamers -- Azul -- Next Move Games -- Text Review
Pregunta:
Article Author: Ally Parker
Publisher: Next Move Games
Game Type: Tile Laying
Designer: Michael Kiesling
Initial Year of Release: 2018
Artist: Philippe Guerin


Theme and What is it?

You have been invited by the King of Portugal to the Royal Palace of Evora. The king, after a visit to southern Spain, has fallen in love with the beautifully laid tiles of the Alhambra palace. You have been tasked, by the king, to enhance the palace walls with your beautiful Moorish tile laying skills. Will you impress the king and be crowned Royal Tile Layer?

Azul is an abstract tile laying game where players compete to earn the most points and the title of Royal Tile Layer.



Gameplay Mechanics

Azul is a tile laying game where players draft tiles from “factories” and place them on their boards. After a number of rounds, the players then use a tile from each row to fill in their wall and score points. During the round, be careful what tiles you choose. If you draw too many tiles of the same type, they will “fall off your table and break on the floor”. This earns you negative points. The game plays over a series of rounds with players taking turns drawing tiles. Once the supply is exhausted, each player then transfers one tile from each row over to their wall and tallies their points.



Initial Impressions

Azul caught my attention right away when I saw it on the shelf. I loved the patchwork look of the box and the color scheme. It was even better when I got home and played it for the first time. The colors are bright and vibrant and the directions were straightforward with clear examples.



Game Build Quality

I only have one complaint with Azul and I will get to that in a minute, so first let me gush. The components of the game are amazing. The tiles are beautiful, smooth and colorful! They are some of the nicest pieces I have seen in a game. Plus, they look fantastic once they are all laid out. The layout board is made of thick cardboard and the printing is high quality which makes the colors pop. The bag you draw tiles from is a high quality burlap material and it aesthetically matches the game.

Onto my one complaint... I wish the player boards had indentations to place the tiles and the score marker. Once the slots start to fill up, it can get a bit messy for my OCD tendencies. This really takes nothing away from the game, but it sure would help my slight neurosis to have everything all lined up.


Artistic Direction

I found Azul very therapeutic to play. The detail and thought that went into the design of Azul is beautiful. The color scheme and layout melted together into a refreshing, relaxing game.



Fun Factor

I have played this game at least a dozen times, and I still want to play it again and again. It’s a game I introduce to new gamers, and I have never heard a complaint. It moves at a steady pace as the players contemplate future moves, but it is not heavy enough to stop the group from talking and enjoying each other’s company.


Age Range & Weight

Azul is rated 8+. Like most games rated for players this young, there will be those who understand the strategies and can keep up with older players, and those who struggle with seeing future moves. Younger players might just pick their favorite color or style of tile and be frustrated with final scoring. My feeling is that 10+ would be more inclusive and most players above that age range would have the processing capacity to make complex decisions. This is an easy game to teach and an easy game to learn, but don’t let that fool you. Azul has depth and rich gameplay. Players will need to forecast their moves and plan strategies to score as many points as possible.



Conclusions

You have probably seen Azul all over the place this year. It’s no wonder, it has incredible gameplay paired with amazing art. There are so many things to like about this game that it appeals to all different types of gamers.

Respuesta 1:
Just in case you're playing this incorrectly,

" Once the supply is exhausted, each player then transfers one tile from each row over to their wall and tallies their points"

this only applies to any full rows not each row.

If a row is not full, it will just sit there, no tiles moved, until it gets filled in a future round.

Respuesta 2:
We were playing it correctly, but yes, you hit the nail on the head that we mis-explained slightly.

Thanks for the catch!



Tema 319: Harder, more cruel variant
Pregunta:
Due to my penchant for fundamentally misunderstanding rulesbooks, I succeeded in creating a more difficult and considerable more antagonist variant of the game.

The rules are broadly the same with two major exceptions:

1) You cannot place the same color tile in more than one pattern line.

2) At the end of each round, after placing any tiles on you wall, remove ALL the remaining tiles from your color lines (e.g. you never start a round with partially complete color lines).

I’ve played this variant with two players dozens of times. I’ve only played it with 3 or 4 players a couple times before someone pointed out I was completely missing the point. It’s fun, takes longer, and leads to more conflict-oriented play as players can more easily block one another from completing rows.

Give it a shot and post up and let me know what you think!

Respuesta 1:
Starting with all empty rows actually makes the game significantly easier, because you never have anything blocked off. You don't know how bad it feels to have 3 tiles stuck in your 4th and 5th rows, with none of that color tile available to fill it. Thus you are dropping everything on the floor!

I was going to say this too. Starting a round with more than one incomplete row really limits your degrees of freedom and makes you vulnerable to being forced into penalty.

Both of those are exactly what my friends and I do. The first couple plays we did it by accident because of not carefully reading the rules. Once we read the rules and realized the mistakes we played the "correct" way a few times and decided the mistaken rule way was more fun, so that is what I always do now. I prefer both of those changes.

Respuesta 5:
So taking strategy out of the game makes the game better?

Fewer choices mean less strategy, not more.

Respuesta 7:

Thats not how I experience. I tried both. Properly rules and this hardcore variant.
Hardcore variant is way more competition and thrilling. Easier to block each other. More interacting between players.

(I suggest to try only number 1.) Not allowed to have multiple colors rows on the leftside.



Tema 320: Azul w/o Scorekeeping variant? (For playing in bed/casually)
Pregunta:
Azul is a great game, especially at Two. And on bed before going to sleep.

But if you want to play it right before going to bed, tracking the scores during the game is kinda boring. Did anyone else have this problem? It sure seemed like a common enough problem that there would be a variant posted for it by now when we tried our hands on it last night.

So... my SO and I tried to make an variant that could work on this situation: skip the scoring phases during the game, only score the final board state. We only scored the end of game bonuses; maybe we could score the tiles placed in the last round too?

Just want to hear your thoughts on the idea, tried just once.

Ideas to try:

- More options to score at the end(diagonals, poker hands, etc)
- Score the last round!
- Do something different with the floor pieces(we played that the person with less leftover tiles goes first on the next round, because we weren't keeping tracking of points).
- Play to another end goal(one line is just too fast)

Respuesta 1:
This should be in the variants section. This allows some of us to block all the variants posted.

Respuesta 2:
Not to sound condescending, but how long does it take you to score each round? For us it’s like 30 seconds. Not enough time to get bored.

Back on track, my main worry with this variant would be floor tiles. Suddenly, first player doesn’t take a penalty at all. Taking too many of a color doesn’t matter. Seems like a lot of strategy and risk/reward gets lost.

It's not because we can't calculate, it's mostly keeping the track marker. The tiles stand on the board on a bed just fine, but the small black cubes doesn't. I admit it was also because both our phones we're charging, otherwise we would have used some app.

Coins or VP chits from another game would work just as well for keeping score and they're not subject to the vagaries of an unpredictable surface

I think your idea of keeping all floor tiles is ok, but still doesn't nullify the first player portion. Being first player has shown to be a significant advantage in many of our games, and this would make it an advantage with no counter disadvantage.

This has all got me thinking of some way to make this work. What about this wild and crazy idea:

For every floor tile you have, including the first player tile, you cannot place one of your pieces from the staging area into the wall. Instead, that piece just gets tossed into the discarded tiles. This would preserve the downside of all floor tiles (in fact, it may make floor tiles even more deadly), and allow you to do your end of game scoring idea.

Write the scores on a piece of paper.

You should also do this when you're not in bed.

Crazy and wild ideas is what this thread is all about. People seem to have failed to grasp this yet.

Maybe I should have posted this on the design problems forum


I like your idea. Maybe we can make it less deadly by using the board: the first two tiles gives -1 piece, the next three gives -2 pieces (not accumulative), and if you get four or more, -3 pieces.

If you find a little piece of rubber or silicone it'll hold onto the board very easily for scoring, rather than slipping around.

Tema 321: Floor Line and Variant
Pregunta:
Is there a reason the first Floor Line space is a different colour than the other six?
-
Does this variant work?
When you have excess tiles, you place the first one on the Floor Line beginning at the second space.. leaving the first coloured one for the Starting Player Marker, if you are first to pick it up.
The first player is only ever penalized one point.
This variant would result in slightly higher negative points when scoring.
It also may detract players taking tiles from the factory to simply discard, which I have noticed, especially in two player games.

What's the motivation for such changes? Do you perceive a problem which needs fixing (e.g. you apparently do't like that players might take tiles from the factory to discard them (to deprive another player of those tiles), but to me that's simply one tactical option which is available and works perfectly fine), or is this just a variant idea for the sake of variety?

Respuesta 2:

The OP's proposal would cause the people who didn't take the start player tile to suffer a larger penalty, putting all their floor tiles one space to the right of where they would in the standard rules.

So in that sense, in this variant taking the first player tile indeed only costs you 1 penalty point, all else being equal. I.e. whether or not you take the start tile, the cost you pay for your other floor tiles is the same. And if you do take the start tile, then you pay only 1 penalty point more.

If you go to the Next Move Game website it appears the Azul Joker tiles, Start Player Tile,Color Set 1 and 2 and Reef Mini Expansion are in stock ready to order, however when you make out the order it says the items are not able to be delivered to my address? Has anyone else encountered this, has anyone been able to get these?

Should be valid, if I’m understanding you.

Yes, you can do these things with the tiles you choose

1. Add them all to one row
2. Add them all to one row, with leftovers falling to the floor
3. Place them all on the floor. You can do this even if you could legally put them in a row.

This can be seen in the rules, with emphasis added by me.

Yes, that would also be legal. Seems like you would be setting yourself up for failure, but still legal.

You can do this but there is a consequence. Each tile in addition to the 7 already placed in the floor line earns -3 points. -14 is not a maximum negative per round.

If all spaces of your floor line are occupied, return any further fallen tiles to the lid of the game box to store them for now.

This thread, from this morning:  .

How much did you pay for yours if you don't mind me asking? £20 is roughly $34 CAD at today's rates.

Respuesta 5:
I paid full retail at a bricks and mortar store....$49.99CAD + sales tax. (I don't mind paying good money for really good games.) Everything else looks fine so I don't think it's counterfeit...might just have been some sloppy quality control at the end of a batch, or something like that.

I was able to verify on a kitchen scale that they are indeed slightly less weight (~4grams per 5 tiles assuming my scale is accurate) and have shared these photos with the publisher. At the end of the day, it's probably not as big of a deal as I had originally thought.



Tema 326: Cheap?

I just came here to post a query about this. There are an awful lot of copies of azul from 17 gbp and 20 gbp on eBay. Thought it might be odd. This is about 60 percent of retail price so looks like these are potentially fake. They all tend to have many copies for sale.

Tema 328: Metro Reviews: Azul
Pregunta:
Metro Reviews are always posted in the GLACIER format. The art/components are broken into three categories to highlight different aspects of the game - especially parts that aren't normally reviewed directly. While I have personal scores in my own collection, I will just leave a general impression at the end. Not every game is for every player, but I can at least let you know how I felt overall.

---

Azul

Gameplay
Azul has clean, simple gameplay with a midweight level of player interaction and a relatively straightforward level of play. Drafting tiles (normally 1-4 per turn but can be as high as 10 or so) to complete a tableau of colours as well as trying to lightly deny your opponents what they need/force them to lose points creates a compelling game.

After drafting the tiles, you'll place them in one of five rows in your tableau. Depending on the size of the row changes the amount of tiles you need to complete each spot. For instance, if you place two blue tiles into the third row, you'll need one more blue tile before it completes at the end of the round. If you don't complete a row before end of round, that row stays clogged until the end of the next round (or whenever you finish it). You need to be careful to not overdraft tiles as any unused in the row are "dropped" for lost points. Additionally once a color has been placed into a row, it cannot be done so again. The game ends once a single horizontal row on ANY player's board completes.

Players score by placing drafted tiles next to other drafted tiles. The more in a consecutive sequence, the more points it earns. Some tiles may also score twice per round based around placement (by scoring in both horizontal and vertical alignment). High score at the end wins.

While the game initally appears to be solvable, due to the way the player choices revolve around the drafting creating a perfect game is much more difficult than it appears at first. Average scores are normally in the 60-70 point range, though high scores of over 100 are easily possible.

The game also has an additional mode where instead of any player having the standard tableau, they can flip it over and play using the standard rules but a non-standard grid.

Learning Curve
The game is quite simple to play. You only have one action (take tiles) and the application of that choice is where it gets (barely) complicated based around what row they need to be placed in. However, you cannot accurately play the game until you learn how it scores and until at least the end of your first/second round of play it's slightly obscured. The concept of scoring for not only what you've played this turn but everything you've scored previously as well can be a weird thing for people to grip. Because the game is a solid abstract newer gamers may not completely understand why they're playing except to score points.

Art and Theme
The "art" of the game (such as it is) functions well for what is happening. They could have done a slightly better job of picking patterns for the solid blue and red tiles to assist in any colourblind situations but otherwise it works well. The theme of the game is pretty thin. You could be easily aligning just about anything into Azul's tableau and it would be just fine. The piece about it tiling a Portugese king's wall is interesting but not really applied.

Components
Definitely a place where the game does well. The player boards and tile "plates" are a thick enough cardboard that they aren't terrible and the tile pieces are extremely high quality. The only downfall of the parts in the game is that the tiles don't have rounded edges, which means when you are pulling out of the provided bag they stand up too often when placing them instead of just falling flat.

Iconography
The placement icons on the player board are well designed to not be confusing, but that's about all there is.

Ease of Teaching
With the eye of teaching newer players this game, the basic concept is very easy to explain (take a tile and play Sudoku with it) the real catch is in explaining the scoring. It's not a hard concept to grasp but does sound weird. It's worth playing the first round before explaining the way that occurs (just tell them they need to try and put the pieces next to each other). It may take a couple rounds but then you can either proceed forward or just restart. You can expect about 5-10 minutes of teaching time overall (5 for initial concept and maybe another five for scoring).

Replayability
Much higher than I initially thought. The main mode (pre-printed tableaus) has enough replayability that unless you are playing this constantly and every game night you really don't need the flip side. It's always a fun personal challenge to beat your high score as well (I'm currently at 116).

Overall
Azul is a solid little package. Relatively inexpensive and providing quite a bit of gameplay. You'll likely be playing this a couple times in a row, especially with new players. I firmly recommend it in a gateway setting or in a lightweight evening.

Nice review.

I picked up this game with the joker expansion which I like.

Respuesta 4:
Sorry but I hadn't written down the rules before! Here they are now.

My aim was to make the game as close to the actual rules as possible. The vast majority of the ‘rules’ below relate to how the Bot chooses and places tiles. I have tried to cover every eventuality but I suspect that this has led to the rules sounding more complicated than they really are!
Please note that I am not actually very good at Azul (losing on a regular basis to both of my son’s) so for the stronger players out there, I have suggested a couple of alterations at the end to make the Bot more competitive.

Human v ‘Bot’ Rules for Azul

Set up the table as normal for a two player game.

The Human plays the game exactly as they would in a real game.

The Bot also follows the usual rules (following the process given below) with three exceptions:
a) When playing more tiles than is needed to complete a pattern line, only the first extra tile drops to the ‘floor line’. Any others go into the box lid.
b) If the Bot takes the starting player marker it does NOT go on his floor line (but he will go first next round as normal).
c) In the scoring phase, each tile that the Bot moves to the wall scores an additional 2 points on top of the normal points scored.

The Bot starts the first round.

The word ‘shop’ used below signifies one of the six possible spaces that tiles may appear (the 5 factory displays plus the ‘centre’).

Factory Offer Stage for the Bot

The Bot randomly chooses a shop from amongst those that have tiles on them. (This could be 1, 2, 3, 4 or 5 shops.)

Once a shop is chosen, the Bot takes the tiles of the colour that has the most tiles in the shop. (If there is a tie for the most tiles of one colour, choose one of those colours at random.)
eg If there was 2 red, 1 blue and 1 black tile in the shop, the Bot would take the 2 red tiles (and, if the shop was one of the factory displays, the other tiles would go into the center as usual). If instead the shop chosen was the ‘center’ and there was 2 red, 2 blue, 2 black and 1 yellow tile, the Bot would choose at random between red, blue and black.
Exception: If the Bot is unable to place any of the chosen colour tiles on a pattern line, he ignores that colour and chooses between the other colours present in the shop (following the same rules). If none of the colours present in the shop will go on any pattern line then the Bot goes back to choosing the colour that has most tiles – placing one on the floor line and the others in the box lid. He does NOT choose a different shop.

Once the Bot has chosen his tile(s) he places them on a pattern line (following the normal placement rules) by choosing the highest possible option in the following list:

1) Complete exactly (ie no excess tiles) a part completed pattern line. (If two or more can be completed exactly, choose the lowest line.)
2) Complete exactly an empty pattern line.
3) Complete a part completed pattern line (putting the first excess tile on the floor line and any others in the box lid). If 2 or more pattern lines can be completed choose the one that requires most tiles. If there is still a choice, choose the lowest pattern line.
4) Complete an empty pattern line (putting the first excess tile on the floor line and any others in the box lid). If there is a choice, choose the lowest pattern line.
5) Place the tiles in a part completed pattern line. If two or more pattern lines can be added to, choose the one that needs the most tiles. If there is still a choice, choose the lowest pattern line.
6) Place the tiles in the lowest empty pattern line.
7) If no tile(s) can be placed on any pattern line, put the first one on the floor line and any others in the box lid.

Everything else is played according to the normal rules.
eg Game ends when one (or both) have a completed row. Whoever takes the starting player marker goes first in the next round. At the end of each round, the tiles in partly completed pattern lines stay on the board. Wall tiling phase is done in the usual way (except for the Bot’s 2 additional points for each tile that goes on the wall). End of game additional points are scored in the normal way. etc.


For a ‘harder’ Bot, change the rules so that he doesn’t put any excess tiles on the floor line. Or, give Bot 3 additional points (instead of 2) for each tile put on the wall. Or both options!


NB To randomly choose a shop I find it easier to put the factory displays in a straight line (and imagine the ‘centre’ to be at the end of the line) and simply use a normal 6 sided die. If there are 5 shops to choose from, ignore any throw of 6. If there are 4 shops to choose from, ignore any throw of 5 or 6. If there are 3 shops to choose from, a 1 or 2 gives 1st shop, a 3 or 4 gives 2nd shop, a 5 or 6 gives 3rd shop. If there are 2 shops to choose from, a 1, 2 or 3 gives 1st shop, a 4, 5 or 6 gives 2nd shop.

When needing to choose at random between 2 or more different colours, I simply put one of each colour in my hands, shake them up and pick one at random.

Respuesta 6:
Played with this yesterday and had fun. Then tried Ricky Royals rules and also have fun. I DO prefer an opponent vs high score, though, so attempted to combine them today.

I used RR's system for choosing the bot's tiles, but placed them with your guidelines (instead of just discarding them). His choice rules add a puzzle element because you can somewhat control what will be taken, and then your rules compound that puzzle since I know what will be chosen AND what will be most beneficial to the opponent.

I'm happy with the resulting game, but will probably need to tweak the scoring (I played with your initial description, +2 and only 1 dropped tile at a time). I won by a significant margin, though, so will try the next round at +3 and 0 penalties for the bot. While not exactly recreating a multiplayer Azul experience, I think we're definitely on the right track for a solid solo experience (without busting out a ton of spreadsheets and creating an Automa deck).

Tema 330: Quality issues with the Scandinavian version. Potential buyers beware!
Pregunta:
Hello everybody,

I was particularly interested in this game not only because of the game play, but also because of the look and feel. So I went out one month ago and bought it from outland (a local game shop here in Oslo) and discovered during my first round of play, that the quality of the tiles and factory tokens were by far not up to my expectations.

All the factory tiles are printed off-center. All the tiles are skuffed and look like they have been in use for a year or so. Some are printed off-center as well.


These are just some examples.

I went back to the store and they basically told me that this is a common problem and I have to contact the manufacturer. They offered me to replace some of the tiles with better ones from their open version (which I declined).
Then I contacted Next Move Games explaining the problem but received no answer.

All of this does not impact the game play of course, but I expected way better quality for a ~500 NOK (about 50€) game.

Keep on gaming!

I help field complaints and the like for us. A few things to note...

There is no exclusive printing to a specific region. We have co-publishers that collaborate in a larger print run. That being said, I don’t think that it’s a regional print.

I rarely see complaints, let alone a lot of scuffed tiles. They do transport and likely related to this. That being said, I would appreciate if you could email me closer pictures with more detail to share with the printer. This can help us and them
Improve processes

Off center printing isn’t the end of the world for me personally, but you deserve a product to be happy with.

I would recommend emailing the local publisher and requesting replacements. They should be able to help. If not, I can. I would need you to email me specific requests of what you would like swapped. Like X solid red tiles, 2 factories displays, etc and your postal address.

Tema 331: Scoring
Pregunta:
My game arrived today minus one of the scoring cubes. I used 4 from Pandemic instead. Problem is, the cubes are so light they are easily moved or knocked from the score sheet. Only played 2 games but it looks as though this could be a problem when we play with our neighbours.
Has anyone found a more efficient or stable way of keeping score? Any ideas for replacement markers? I'm not a good lateral thinker so any suggestions would be welcome!

You're missing one cube, so you replaced it with 4? I don't understand unless you're just doing so all the cubes look alike. So, don't do that and just give the one odd cube to player least likely to be clumsy.

Respuesta 4:
Record the scores with pencil and paper.

Respuesta 5:
Or laminate the boards and use dry erase markers to record the scores.

Alternatively (which I saw in the Terraforming Mars forum): Buy a cheap silicone cooking accessory, cut it in small pieces and use those as markers. Those do not slip.

Respuesta 6:
Thx. Some good ideas here for future reference. I've now borrowed 4 pawns from my Forbidden Island which we rarely play and they fit in the board a treat and seem to be quite stable. Annoyed about the missing bit though - this game certainly isn't cheap and it seems from others here that I'm not the only one who has had this problem. At least I wasn't missing the playing boards as one reviewer reported!



Tema 332: First player disadvantage?
Pregunta:
So my family got Azul for Christmas and we are loving it! It is probably already the most played game in our house.

However after 10+ games (I know this is still a small number of games), we are seeing a trend where the first player of the game never wins.

We have seen this with both 2 player and 4 player. We did discover we were playing a rule wrong, but we don't think this would affect the outcome since we were all playing with the same handicap.

So I am just wondering if anyone else has noticed this or do we just need to put in more plays, which we fully intend to do!

What rule where you getting wrong? Do you realize that the first player may change every round, depending on who takes from the center area first?
No, we are doing that right. And I am only counting the starting first player. We would not even given the penalty for the first round.

What we were doing wrong was placing the same color on multiple rows. We were playing that any time you had to take more of the same color of a row you already filled (or left over after you filled a row) would immediately go to your floor, even if you still had other empty rows.

Respuesta 4:
So you were playing half correct with that.

As you have realized, you can put tiles of the same color into multiple rows. This must be done in multiple tile pulls.

When you take tiles, those tiles must go into one row. Any tiles that don't fit into that row must fall to the floor. You can NOT put tiles into more than one row from a single pull.

For what it's worth, I can see how your misinterpretation would severely hurt the first player. They would easily get into a situation of not being able to place tiles faster than any other player.

Just for reference purposes, here are two separate quotes to show the wording from the rules (my highlight).


Then add the tiles to one of the 5 pattern lines on your player board ...


Any tiles you have picked that you cannot or do not want to place according to the rules, you must place in your floor line, filling its spaces from left to right.

I am wondering if you misunderstand how tiles are meant to be taken from the center. Just like the other locations, you remove all tiles of a single color.

(so there may only be 2 or 3 tiles of color "x", and thus not likely to create a penalty for you - apart from the "Start" player tile)

This is about where I fall too right now. I haven't tried it yet, so I guess I have no idea. It might add more than I want.

Respuesta 5:
I played the blank wall once after we had played a few times under the normal wall. However I ended up just using the same pattern from the normal wall once I had created a line. So my end result looked more or less the same exact idea the normal wall had. I lost by one point if I remember correctly.

I guess I didn't see the point of deviating too much from the normal structure because it made the game less "fluid" when I playing it and scoring afterwards. I like the idea of the concrete pattern that you can base your point spread on.

So I'm not sure how it adds pleasure into the process, if that makes any sense. I'd be pleased to understand that part more from you gamers who have done the blank wall far more.

Respuesta 6:
Martin G
@qwertymartin

Same here. After somewhere between 20 and 30 plays, Azul is my #2 game of all time. I've played the blank wall twice, and will probably never play it again. I don't think it's fair to just characterize the blank wall as an advanced variant, as opposed to the "simple" pre-printed wall.

Respuesta 7:
If it wasn’t for the blank wall, this game would have started collecting dust months ago. As it is, I only play the blank side and keep it in my regular rotation. I wouldn’t call it more advanced, but more subject to skill and competition than the printed side.



Tema 337: Scoring App?

I was surprised to see a lack of companion app to help you score the game quickly, specifically for kids. My daughter and I played our first game yesterday; we scored the first round together, but after we were done I asked her how she scored the final round and it was wrong...

FWIW people I game with usually check each other (not only in Azul, but in games generally), as it doesn't add much time and it seems clearly worth it (for us, anyway) for catching occasional errors, and even occasional rule misunderstandings.

A less tangible benefit is that it also seems to make everyone more aware of everyone else's score and current state instead of only focussing on their own board/state.

I taught and played two full games with my sister and her boyfriend (both 33 years old) each person scoring one at the time so we would be sure everyone was doing it right. On the third one we felt they could do it by themselves asking me in case of any doubt.

Like Dennis said, I think you could spent a bit more turns helping her instead of relying on a cellphone app. Doing one one person at time you can show her again how it goes (specially because late turns have more points than at the beginning) and oversee how she does it and correct her on any mistake.

Tema 338: Purple Phoenix Games Review
Pregunta:
Original is found at: http://www.purplephoenixgames.com/azul-review/



We are late to the game. Almost always. I mean, we BUY new games. We watch videos on them to learn. We then digest the rulebook and teach it to whomever is interested in playing with us. Then we play. Sometimes we can only get a few games in and we have to decide their fate in our collection after just a play or two or three. But then there are games that our wives buy us for Christmas that wasn’t even on our list, but she was on the publisher’s website buying a different game that WAS on our list, but thought this game was pretty so she decided to buy it for us (as well as the cute little expansion) and then decides she wants to play it and it turns out to be a really great game that we enjoy playing a whole bunch.

Uh. Sometimes I get too excited introducing a game. We are talking about Azul. O.G. Azul.

Ok, so you are supposed to be building a fancy tiled wall in Portugal. The game comes with these fancy Starburst (not a sponsor) looking bakelite pieces – if you have played Hive you know the ones – and they are very colorful and cute. Everyone gets their own player board and score tracking cube. Then the game is afoot.

The player with the most points at the end of the game wins. Standard. I’m not going to go into the entirety of a rules explanation. Instead, I’m going to give you my review.



After having played it a dozen times or more, I absolutely love it. It is by far my favorite abstract strategy game that I have played. The components are fun to play with, the rules are light – most players can grasp the concept and gameplay – and it’s quick enough that you can play multiple games in a row if you so choose.

That said, we at Purple Phoenix Games give it a 24 / 24 and award it a well-deserved Golden Feather Award!

Thanks for these improvements.

The only thing you’re missing regarding scores going below zero is that it is explicitly mentioned and prohibited in the rules of the game Rojo is based on. So, if rules compliance is important to you then it should probably be changed, if not, well, there will just continue to be a scoring difference between these games.

With the scoring mostly fixed now, maybe the high scores should be reset. The existing posted high scores seemed abnormally high to me, based on my experience with the game.

I suppose in a perfect game you would fill your wall from top to bottom, left to right. So you would complete column 1 first, scoring each tile as you placed it, top to bottom, for 15 points (1+2+3+4+5), then column 2 would be 24 points (2+4+5+6+7). Column 3 would be 29 points, column 4 would be 34 points, column 5 would be 39 points.

So for tile placement points you would have 141 points.
For 5 complete rows you would get 10 points.
For 5 complete columns you would get 35 points.
For all 5 sets of colors completed you would get 50 points.

So best possible score is the sum of those = 236

Tema 340: Misprinted Tiles
Pregunta:
I noticed during my first game of Azul today that at least one of my tiles is missing the printing in one corner - has anyone else noticed the same problem?

Respuesta 1:
Here's a sample of tiles I have issues with. As you can see from the left-most tile, a portion of the printing is missing.

With the second-left the printing is quite mis-aligned.

Finally the far-right tile is somewhat 'inflated' compared to its counterpart, so much so it wobbles when you nudge the table.

Respuesta 2:
Did you purchase it from a reputable game retailer? I've seen some suspiciously cheap imported versions offered for sale on eBay.

Respuesta 3:
I did, I purchased from a FLGS :-)

Respuesta 4:
I have the same issue with exactly 1 tile.
Is this really such an issue?
You understand these are not hand made tiles, but mass produced in china? And the game costs 30$ and not 3000$?

I think you should set your expectations better

Respuesta 5:
If it was one tile, I doubt I would have been bothered. But I've noticed more and more and have issues with at least 10 tiles.

I think your expectations may be backwards, I could understand variation in handmade items, but as you say these are mass-produced so I'd expect some more consistency ;-)

In any case Asmodee UK were happy to replace them, and they've arrived today.

Respuesta 6:
Handmade means each item is quality checked by human hand making it.

Mass produced means quality check by human is done on very small percentage of actual items.

But that's not the point.
Point is it is cheap.
I am not judging, in my case, the problem was minor and easy to ignore, so I ignored it.

In OP case it might influence the playability of the game. I don't know.

Respuesta 7:
The mis-shapen tiles definitely did, though in the end it was more of a, "Oh hey I've got the wobbly tile again ".

With the mis-printed tiles, we'd just end up flipping them over, so not a massive deal, but something that I was growing ever more concious of.

As the previous poster said, mass-produced means it should be more consistent. If they were hand-made, that's when variances are to be expected.

The problem is these days, there no quality control, so mass-produced means lots of sloppy work getting through.
I may venture to say that hand crafted does increase the likelihood of minor variances. Alternatively we are in the hundreds of thousands (I wonder if we are at a million) of Azuls published. Each game has 101 tiles that’s millions of tiles.

I don’t see a ton of requests for misprint tiles. I suspect people don’t mind or the occurrence is minor.

Either way, if anyone is unhappy - contact me.

These tiles are placed according to particular rules on the left side of the board, and at the end of each round, finished rows enable players to move a tile to the right side of the player board and score points. There are some nuances and placement rules, but that’s the main idea of the game. There are bonuses for finishing horizontal rows and vertical rows, as well as for finishing all five available spots for a particular tile type. The game ends when someone completes a horizontal row, and that’s when the bonuses are awarded.



I've played it so much because:
1. It’s very easy to teach and to learn. I can teach Azul in two minutes or less. As with most good gateway games, new players can be competitive on their first play; however, experienced players have tended to win when I’ve played with both. I like that Azul toes the line by offering an advantage to experienced players while also generally allowing new players a chance at winning.
2. It involves more thought than you’d initially suspect. Azul is not at all a “deep” game, and there are few new strategies to explore after just a few games. However, my grasp of the game’s nuances and circumstance-driven decisions has improved with every play. I’ve picked up a lot of ideas from playing against my wife, who tends to excel at games like this.
3. It offers some interesting twists to the gateway genre. I like having a variety of go-to gateway games because I primarily play with non-gamers, new gamers, and reluctant gamers. Plan B is on a serious roll with good gateway games, most notably   and  . Azul is one of the best tile-laying games in the genre (joining   and others), but it also introduces drafting. It’s a nice mix.
4. It looks fabulous on the table. Azul’s visual appeal is enough to cover the lack of theme. It’s an abstract game that I’ve seen work really well with reluctant gamers or non-gamers because of its aesthetic. The tiles and player boards are of excellent quality. My only complaint about the game’s components is that the score marker can easily be knocked away, which is pretty much a disaster.



I'd play it more if:
1. It were less mean. I saw a marriage nearly end while playing this game on a double date. You can ROYALLY screw someone over in Azul.
2. They’d created designs on all the tiles. I’m still uncertain as to why three of the tiles are covered with beautiful patterns and two are plain colors. One plain tile would work well, but I think they should’ve added one more design.

Rating: (8.5/10)

Overall: Azul is simply one of the best gateway games I’ve found in my 3.5 years in the hobby. That’s mostly what Azul is for me, though: a gateway game. I’ve played it twenty times and will play it twenty more, but it only sees the table in gateway situations or when I’m playing with light gamers like my wife. Azul’s quick to teach (~2-5 minutes) and quick to learn, and the strategies are a bit minimal. The tactics, though, are pretty interesting. Even after twenty plays I’m still picking up new tricks and nuances. On top of the game’s strong gateway gameplay, it looks fantastic. The tiles and player board are exceptional, especially if you can look past the dubious decision of leaving two of the five tile sets blank and the score marker that can easily be knocked off. I recommend Azul to anyone who enjoys light, gateway-style games, and my only caveats of substance are its lack of deep strategy and the fact that it can get rather mean. Azul is an 8.5/10 for me and a certain entry into my third annual top 50 list next month.

Peter,
Another solid review. I like your format.

I agree that Azul is a great gateway game, but for me, it’s more than a gateway. Since last December, it is my most played game. It has become a “go to” family game. Admittedly, all my children are adults, so the meanness factor is a plus for us. At game nights, it has often become a “warm up" game until everyone gets there. Sometimes we play it when waiting for longer games to finish. At my gaming group, it is one of our most played games. At least in my experience, while it might not be   or  , it is certainly a filler game that gamers can appreciate.

And I concur. The player board and tiles that actually do have patterns is already busy enough. Without those solid color tiles to offset things a bit, it would be gaudy.

Hi,

just wanted to add my comment, i hope thats ok.
I bought game yesteraday on some holiday sale, knew this was entry game and I expected something like Imhotep, Alhambra or Settlers of catan.
I am heavy gamer and play and like complex games, but from time to time I wish to play something simple and fast.
So we (me and wife) bought the game - and I can tell you , game is way better then we expected.
You have to plan, you have to watch what other player is doing and you have to plan best combos for you.
Game was really big suprise for me - to be honset i didnt expect much, but it is so clever designed that you can learn rules in 5 minutes without any misunedrstandings and looking FAQs, forums etc...game is smooth, fast, clever and satisfying.
After first game we immeditely played 6-7 more.
Time flys by when you play and I can really recommend it.
It is mystery for me how some designers find those ideas.
Btw - this game somehow reminds me on mix of Fresco and Imhotep, but i dont know why because it is really unique .

So game is for me solid 9.5/10 (I give 10/10 only if i am on brink of quiting my job and wanting to play game all the time without eating etc...)

I have very much enjoyed Azul as well. I have three comments for improvements.


1. Lost tiles are inevitable, I found one while sweeping under the couch today, but in the meantime it would have been nice to have a set of spares to be included with the game. I've gotten my lost tiles back, but usually not right away.

2. Combining two games allowed us to play with 7 players, which worked out easier than anticipated. That was how we discovered that we were missing tiles, then we didn't know whose game showed up with less than 20 tiles of each color.

3. Having the score board on a central board at a common location would allow for less bumping and thus losing track of the score.



Tema 342: Scoring question
Pregunta:
After the second game... me and my wife we have a question ...after the first or the second round if we discard to many tiles then points we made so far...and the minus points are more than the points made so far, what do we do, we go less than 0 eg.-2 or else? or we stop at zero and start the new round at zero?

Respuesta 1:
According to the rules, you can never drop below 0 points, so no negative scores. Also, the track does not allow for it.

Tema 344: RATS ! I've been playing this all wrong
Pregunta:
I have been playing that only one of each color is allowed on the pattern side of the board.

Then last evening I accused a player of making an illegal move and out came the rulebook. Turns out that you can have the same color multiple times on the pattern side.

Now the game seems so much easier and higher scoring, not to mention less cut throat. I'm not sure I like that. I kind of liked being able to dump a bunch of one color on a player who already had that color completing a line on the pattern side.

I made the same mistake with the rules which leads me to believe I watched a overview video that had them wrong. Like you, I couldn't find that rule anywhere in the rulebook. I too like it with that rule in place: only one color is allowed at any time.

This does seem to be an exceedingly common mistake. I guess the rulebook could do with emphasising that it is allowed.

I like the rule exactly as it stands.

Respuesta 5:
Yep, we played it wrong at first, too. I've played it the 'right' way a couple times, and I must say I haven't really noticed the change much.

Respuesta 6:
The printed rule wording never says a second line of the same color is prohibited. Neither is there explicit wording to say it is allowed. Nonetheless the illustrations on page 4 for B. Wall-Tiling definitely show that it can be done (Blue tiles).

Respuesta 7:
The important part that I got wrong is, even if you can have the same color in different rows, you can't put them there in the same turn. You can't put one red tile in the 5 row, and two more in the 2 row on the same turn. You have to pick one row and place tiles there only.

Adding that rule here just for reinforcement. The quote below has the word "one" bolded, just as it is in the rules.

Then, add the tiles you picked to one of the 5 pattern lines on
your player board (the first line has 1 space to hold 1 tile, the fifth
line has 5).

Looks like we have the same rats infestation.

I was taught the game a few weeks ago - with the incorrect rules described above.

Two different people read the rules, one even took notes. We all then referred back to what appeared to be key sections in the rules and that was one. Even with all the oversight and additional review we ended up with consensus that you couldn't have the same color in multiple rows/pattern lines (not wall).

We played all day yesterday and by the end of the day the strategy of sticking someone with these "restricted" tiles was everyone's favorite aspect of the game without a doubt. Looking back to the rulebook now I don't see an actual rule for this and I do see the single scoring example image that shows we were incorrect. Like the original poster though, it will be difficult to go back. We'll try it correctly next time but it's going to be hard to compete with the enjoyment we got out of the more restrictive interpretation of the rules.
As the rounds go on, though, this is the effect any way. If I already have a red on my 4 th and 5 th row of my wall, and I take red for my 3 rd row, im pretty vulnerable to a red dump. You still get to use this strategy, but increasingly as the game goes on.

Respuesta 16:
Why does taking red on 4th, 5th and 3rd rows make you more vulnerable to a red dump? Isn't it the case that you would be able to fit more red on your board (one row per turn), hence less likely people will want to feed you red?

In the example there are already red tiles on the wall (right side of the board) in the 4th and 5th row, meaning red tiles can no longer be placed in the corresponding working rows (left side of the board).
If you now place red in the 3rd working row that only leaves the 1st and 2nd working row (if they are empty) and any remaining space on the 3rd working row available to place red tiles, meaning you would at most be able to place 2 red tiles during a turn with any excess going to the floor.



Tema 345: Missing... player board?
Pregunta:
I searched the forum for this issue but all I found were people who couldn't find the old cardboard first player token and a couple of reports of missing tiles.

I've just received my copy of Azul and it's only got 3 player boards in it I've been through everything twice, looked underneath the plastic insert in the box to see if it was under there for some reason but no. Everything else is present and correct.

I bought it off eBay but it is a brand new, shrink wrapped Next Move edition of Azul. It's going to be a bit of a PITA to report this, get it refunded/sent back/replacement issued. Wondering if there was anything else which can be done. Plan B/Next Move - got any spare boards you could send me?

I have the same problem, it must be a production failure. The game was shrink wrapped so nobody could have stolen it from the shop, it must have been delivered that way. I didn't return it cause i love playing it and i could have only gotten the money back as they run out of games.

edit Feb 17th: As next move never even managed to reply to their very own comment section within an order nor reply to any emails, i wrote pegasus and got an answer within a week and the missing board is on its way already.

Respuesta 14:
Definitely an error at production. Mine only had 3 also. I actually just wrote to plan B games this week as they were also warped. The boards don't lay flat, which doesn't help when laying tiles. The box lid also doesn't fit flush as the curved boards lift the lid slightly.

I haven't heard back from them yet.

The collector tiles were never intended as replacements for the solid blue or red. In fact the collector tiles are orange and teal.

Also to point out, as mentioned, it’s a bit of visual sensory overload.

We don’t fracture rights of the game up, but DSP is a prize awarded by the German media review group. We (and many other publishers) lend the license of the game over as a thank you, their annual box of promos is a huge revenue driver for the organization.

Now never say never, it’s a possibility that it could happen that a bundled edition comes out, but presently there are no plans.

And I do like the promos in this particularly box, I was involved in crafting ideas for an Azul expansion and these were an idea I dreamt up for a module. It was apparently good enough to publish. Maybe it was coincidence.

Interesting.

I might try simplifying further by allowing the player to just choose a set of the most available to withdraw on Dummy's turn.

Scores will be higher but adds something additional the player can influence (and I would not have to remember the checklist of what the Dummy does!)

Cheers Ricky for posting.

Nice. I think I just worded it more complex than I needed to. I could just say, Dummy takes the largest set of 2 or more, otherwise grabs a random singleton. Take from the leftmost factory display to break ties and only take from the centre if there are sets in the centre and only singletons in the Factory, or if the Factory is empty.

Curious if people have tried this and what kinds of scores you are ending up with. I heard you mention 85 in the playthrough video as a target goal and I'm just wondering if anyone has approached that or what kinds of average scores you all are getting.

AZUL Solo Variant by Box of Delights

Respuesta 6:
Hi Ricky,

tried your solo-version with a little twist.

I like full-information games, so to remove the randomness of the draw between ties, I used the 5 tilelines on the playerboard to decide the priority.

Meaning that in round 1, dummy priotize:
blue, yellow, red, black, lightblue.
Round 2, light blue, blue, yellow, red, black
and so forth.

I scored 61 in my first try.

Thanks for the variant! Much appriciated.

I tried this variant for the first time this morning and it works great. Scored 67, I've realised recently that I really appreciate beat your own score solo games so I look forward to the next game.

Then I opened up my copy of Azul: Stained Glass of Sintra , read the multiplayer rules and tried this solo variant with that version and it works great too. The only change from the standard Azul version being that you play six rounds, refilling the bag when required as in the multiplayer game, rather than ending when the bag is empty. Edited to add: I scored 71, my first ever game, so I guess 85 as a target is reasonable here too.

Thanks again Ricky.

Thanks so much for making and sharing this variant, Ricky. I've been looking for a good solo variant for Azul for a while now. This one hits the spot for me. I especially like that, even though playing solo eliminates the push-your-luck tension of multiplayer drafting, your variant replaces that with a different kind of tension--trying to force the AI to take tiles you don't need and leave the ones you do. It's an interesting puzzle to solve.

Not that I've solved it, of course. I scored 41 my first game (ouch) and 65 my second.

Love this version (the only one i came across)
However, in case there are multiple choices of what dummy would do, I ask Google to throw a dice for me (google assistant on my phone),
and then i count clockwise which one to take,
otherwise if i know dummy's behaviour, I start to calculate what will it do on the next turn...,
so, i decided to randomize this process with google's help ))

My best score is 56, and i really did my best... i can't imagine what folks do to get 88 ))



Tema 348: Could this be a best first move?
Pregunta:
I played for the first time last night, but it seems to me that while playing the basic variant, if possible you should always prioritize getting the middle blue tile of the board (third row, third column) in the first round because it's the best starting point to build your columns and rows around it, of course you can argue that columns 2 and 4 are giving similar value, but it still seems to me that middle blue tile gives you the most options afterwards

Much would depend on other factors like the tile distribution in the center, and what previous players have already done on their first move.

But FWIW a recent discussion noted that (perhaps counter-intuitively) you'll get more points by placing the intersection of an L later rather than first. E.g. placing the center first and then growing from it like:

2
1 3

gives you 1+2+2 = 5 points

but going in this order:

1
3 2

gives you 1+1+4 = 6 points.

Respuesta 2:
It is far more important to fill multiple spots in the same column, no matter what column it is. And that depends on what tiles are available that round.

Adjacency doesn't really matter until the end. By the end of the game, ideally the spots you filled in a given row or column are all connected, but it doesn't matter much what order those happened. Yes, a particular order may be worth a few more points, but you have to go with the colors that are available.

Respuesta 3:
Personally, if there are 3 of a colour in one 'pot', and particularly if it wouldn't go in one of the edge columns (furthest left or furthest right), I'll usually take that as first pick. I'll then try and get the 2 and then the 1, that would go above it in the same column, meaning that I'll get 5 points that round.

If I can't do the above by taking 3 of the colour directly, I'll try and take the two, and the one, and make up the 3 from multiple pots (either by taking it over multiple turns or by waiting until it gets to the middle).

My husband, on the other hand, prefers to make good progress on the bigger rows (where as I may only ever complete one or 2 5's over the game). So if he sees there is a lot of one colour (in all the pots added up) he'll prioritize taking that colour.

Oh yes, poor maths on my part!

I can't remember actually ending up with 6 points after the first round, (even though I often do the above) as I usually end up either having to take the the first player marker, or some normal tiles end up on the floor.

Going a little further, staring with an L:

X 1 3     X 1 2     X 2 3
X X 2     X X 3     X X 1

are all identical at 12;

X 2 1     X 3 1
X X 3     X X 2

are 11, and

X 3 2
X X 1

is alone in last place at 10.

Which means that if a tile can't be placed safely in the crook of the L, then a tile diagonal to it (row 2) is slightly conservative, while a tile extending it to a long L is slightly risky.

I think this is more relevant to the open side of the boards, where a much more viable strategy is to rush the first two rows, with just a couple of tiles in row 3, while taking almost no penalties and maximizing placement points.

I'm not understanding this post. Your top examples are NOT the same, as the center one only adds up to 5 points, while the other two are 6. Even if you put another tile in the crook to make a square, that would only be 9 or 10 points total. Where does the 12 come in? Same for the 11 and 10 you post. I am just not following what you are trying to say.

Discarding tiles to the box insert makes refilling the bag just a tad bit cumbersome. I could totally just use some kind of bowl instead (as has been suggested elsewhere on these forums), but I'd rather have something that can be stored in the box. Might just end up buying a really large generic dice bag/tarot card bag, but would prefer something themed.

Can't find the option anywhere online to purchase a standalone blue Azul bag, or even the pink one that comes with Stained Glass. Contacted Next Move through their website but haven't heard back. Really great game, I just like upgrading my games and making playthroughs as streamlined and comfortable as possible.

the 4 black cubes should be in 4 different colors, so each player can be a "color" and you could use them on a common scoretrack easily, even on the 4th player board in 3 player games. change 3 of the black to red/blue/orange and the design is better!

Tema 351: Azul (CybesWebsite reviews)
Pregunta:
Azul
Take on the role of a Renaissance mosaic tile master, crafting a stunning work of art. Compete against your rivals and emerge as the best!

Publisher:
Next Move Games

Authors/Artists:
Michael Kiesling, Philippe Guérin, Chris Quilliams

Genre:
Renaissance, abstract pattern

Type of game:
Tile Placement

Concepts: Azul is a tile placement game based in which players compete to complete a pattern before anybody else, scoring points for doing so in an efficient manner. You will need to buy the right tiles to stand a chance of winning. Players gain points by completing horizontal or vertical lines on the pattern, whilst wasting tiles will cost you points. The player with the most points by the end wins.

Writing: Azul’s rulebook is laid out in a clear and simple manner, in sections that are easy to find and understand. It is functional but lacking in unnecessary additional flourishes. Players should have no issue in understanding the game’s operation from the rules as written. It is extremely easy to pick up and play. However like many abstract games, Azul’s focus is not on its theme and therefore fans of games with stronger themes may find that it lacks appeal.

Mechanics: Each player has a board upon which tiles are placed. To one side is placed a number of circular ‘factory’ boards. At the beginning of each turn, players select tiles to add to their board from the a factory board – during this selection, only tiles of the same colour can be chosen from a factory, with the remaining being placed into a central pile between the factory boards. Whilst each factory board can hold only four tiles (and are refreshed at the end of each turn), the central pile can hold any number.
Once the player has acquired their tiles, they are placed onto the board – each player’s boards includes a scoring area, a pattern (where the tiles eventually end up), a set of five horizontal pattern rows with spaces for the tiles to go (the top row has space for one, two for the second, all the way down to five), and a floor line (where you don’t want tiles to go). Once drawn from the factory, each player places their tiles into one of the pattern rows – any that you cannot fit go to the floor line where they start racking up penalties to the player’s score. Once a pattern row is full, the right-most tile on that row is placed on the pattern, in the same horizontal line as the pattern row and to its corresponding space for that tile’s colour. Other tiles in that row that remain are removed from the game. Tiles earn points with bonuses for completing full rows and columns, and the player with the most points is the winner.

Design: Like the writing, this is functional. Tiles are nice, a fair size and sturdy and come with a bag that is nicely embroidered and stylish. The colour choices are easy to read and the patterns are strong, meaning that this game would work well with players who have issues with pattern recognition. One flaw that I did find is that the scoring area only lists numbers in increments of 5s and 10s, which may be problematic for some players.

Playability: Azul is fantastically playable. Each phase of the game offers a variety of different strategies for the enterprising player. Choices that are made when selecting tiles from the factory can have a huge impact, and a cunning decision can gain them a strong advantage in later turns. Do you grab one tile in order to load it right onto your top row, or do you try to load the centre pile with enough of one colour in the hopes of snatching five of them later and place one on the bottom row? Every turn provides the players with a plethora of decisions to make. As each player is striving to achieve the same goal, gameplay very quickly becomes a rush to trying to figure out one another’s strategies.

Conclusion: Overall we enjoyed Azul. Gameplay is a challenging experience due to the number of decisions that need to be made each turn, but it is easy enough to learn and quick to get into, allowing this game to work very much as a family game. Whilst not excessively competitive, it is a very enjoyable experience and it is clear to see why it has become such an award-winner.

AFAIK yes, but also AFAIK they junk up that line and you get nothing for completing it again. Don't have the rules right in front of me.

Tema 354: Collector's Tiles have arrived...but the colors do not match.
Pregunta:
It's not a dealbreaker, and I haven't tried it in-game to see if the color change has any practical implications.

But:

When I ordered the collector tiles, I assumed that the designs not being on the basic game side of the board would be a little confusing for new players, but was ready to deal with that. What I didn't expect is that the once-dark blue would be so light, and the once-red would veer into orange. There's still only logically one kind of spot for them,and it doesn't really make it harder to play, but aesthetically that does not seem like a great decision for what is purely a cosmetic upgrade.



Anyone else have thoughts on this? Is this then headed towards needing new basic boards for the game?

Respuesta 1:
They aren't supposed to be the same colors as the ones in the game box.

They're the colors of the Next Move logo.

Respuesta 2:
Yes, they are intentionally orange and teal, not red and blue.

As their website states:
Quote:
The Collector Tile Sets offer an alternative set of 20 tiles to replace the player’s choice of a tile pattern included in the box. These sets offer a wonderful alternative set to play on the variant side of the player board. The first two colors – Orange and Teal were selected as a nod to Azul’s publisher – Next Move Games!
You are actually supposed to replace one of the patterns, not the red or blue.

Respuesta 3:
Well that's definitely on me, I did not read the prompt, clearly, and just assumed that they would be replacements for the more boring tiles. Makes a lot more sense now! Thank you for the clarifications.



Tema 355: Only one viable strategy?
Pregunta:
Hi,

I played it 10+ times, and I wonder if there is only one viable strategy to win:



Your two cents?

Thank you,
Gabriele

Respuesta 1:
There's no particular advantage to doing one column at a time, but obviously ending up with multiple columns complete is a good goal

Respuesta 2:
Our group has experimented with a few different approaches.

I like to take whatever I can finish a bottom row with first and then concentrate on finishing that color and column where it is first placed. Finishing 2 colors can be very lucrative but I more often close out a color and 2 columns.

My wife just likes to build off of a cluster so that every tile she lays is netting her lots of points throughout the game, maybe finishing a column or two, probably 1-2 rows. She does very well, better than me most of the time. She's not too picky and is great at spotting easy points.

Then there's my friend who just hate-drafts the whole time trying to dump huge amounts of worthless tiles on you and actively preventing you from finishing those longer rows causing your scoring to be much delayed. His board doesn't always score well, but you're not reaching your potential either.

Respuesta 3:
In Azul tracking what your opponent is working on is very important. 1) It will inform you on what you need to do to stop your opponents from getting those points; and 2) it also helps you "predict" what tiles you can "leave for later" cuz it's not what the other players need, etc.

Finally, the amount of points you get is also independent of the order you build the final shape. That is, a triangle of tiles will result in the same amount of points regardless of whether you play the corner tile first or last.

Building columns do give you a bonus, but I don't see the advantage of going 'column-to-column' as oppose to simlutaneously trying to do one column+"all five tiles of one color"; etc.

That's not actually true. If you do the corner first you'll get 1 + 2 + 2 = 5. If you do the corner last you get 1 + 1 + 4 = 6.

You're right... I had to recheck the rules... In this case, then clustering is the best way go (if possible). And fully building a column before moving to the next it's not going to give you lots opportunities to do this. I.e. the best you could do is a cross where the last tile to be placed is the center tile.

I do remember thinking about the clustering as very important... not sure why I would f'ed that up after thinking about it.

Respuesta 6:
I obviously can't know this to be true, but my suspicion is that most groups don't play this game anywhere near as cutthroat as it needs to be played. Any discussion of strategy always has that doubt in my mind.

Respuesta 7:
I'm impressed that people are talking about "finishing a column then starting another". In my experience most people don't get a chance to finish more than one column because the game is over by then! In fact, most of the time I see a lot of people don't even get one column completed.

That will certainly depend on the play styles / strategies of the group. If even one person wants to make the game end quickly, then it will end much quicker than if everyone is e.g. trying to finish column after column as the original post proposes.

He doesn't like the game and only plays because his friends force him to. So his priority is not winning it, but ending it as quickly as possible.

Respuesta 12:
I don´t think there is only one strategy you can aim for in every game. In our family it seems to be quite the opposite as we in fact develop an ever evolving meta game.

For example, I started to play the "speed game". You try to always put a tile in the first and second row. The game finishes after 5 rounds hopefully before your opponents finish a column or colour. It worked well for two or three games but not anymore as my wife and daughter adapted their strategy and counter it most of the time.

It´s exactly this hidden depth what makes me love this game.

No. 100% win rate in gaming group in perhaps a dozen games. (Two losses though when I explained it to casual gamers and did not focus on winning.)

Filling the first and/or second row is always easy. Hardly any opportunity cost, or only a very small one in the 5th round where you need one specific color. You can always force an early end after 5 rounds, while it is impossible to prolong the game to 6+ rounds. You cannot realistically prevent someone from ending the game in round 5. Therefore, I consider optimizing for 5 rounds a dominant strategy.

(Note: I am talking about 4 player games and this assumption should be valid for 3 players as well. For 2 players and only 5 bowl of tiles, I am not sure, though.)

Respuesta 14:
If you always end it in five rounds, always win and your opponents know that, you might need better opponents

Respuesta 15:
A) It were not always the same opponents.
B) It took me a few games to realized that 5 rounds is the way to go.

BTW: Optimizing for five turns does, of course, not answer every question on strategy. There a are lot of other things, from the order of placements on the grid (which can make a difference on points) over jockeying for player order (usually it is good to be first) to playing in such a way that you are not vulnerable to hate drafting in the last rounds, e.g. by having the flexibility to either complete a column or a full color set, such that your opponents cannot prevent both.

But as a general guideline, I think it is correct to say: it you play for 6+ rounds, you will lose because someone will end the game after 5 rounds. And even if you can end the game in round 5, no one says that you have to do so if it does not mean winning. Being able to end the game in round 5 gives you control over the game end. Having this control is always better then being dependent on you opponents' choices.

Ehm, no.

While the example of the triangle seems to suggest this, it is incorrect.

Cross with center piece last: 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 6 = 10
Cross with triangle as above first: (1 + 1 + 4) + 3 + 3 = 12

Respuesta 22:
Essentially if force end in 5 turns anyone hoping for a 6+ strategy is likely in a disadvantage otherwise their 6th+ turn is just padding anyways. You won't always win though because others could get a better optimized beginning turns no matter their overall strategy.

The snowflake blue tiles taste the best!

That is why it's probably better to go top right to bottom left than vice-versa, since it gives you more flexibility in colours. In contrast, left to right diagonals require much more of a single colour. So, always place a tile on the first row if you can as unceremoniously as you would like or feel like those tiles deserve.

Also of note, if you finish a colour prematurely, other Azul's artisans can force you to take tiles you can't place for tons of negative points.

Respuesta 24:
My experience is this strategy is not good at the very beginning if you sacrifice anything for it. Filling a column first is good if you can, but I'd rather successfully fill 4 rows to place tiles randomly than fill 3 which are in a column. On round 1 anyway.

Long term strategy is not something I'd advise. Intentionally maintaining the ability to end the game on round 5 is advised, but even not trying usually someone will have that anyway. IMO being ahead by the end of round 5 is a necessity, you can sometimes stall out the game another round, but not further than that.

And yeah I think a successful player needs to play mean. Especially in a 1v1. Locking someone into rows they can't finish in that round is extremely powerful because aside from depriving points now, it cripples their ability to accept tiles in the next round, as space on their board will be limited. If you can hurt your opponent more than you can help yourself, you should. It may be tempting to take those 5 reds for your empty 5th row, but is that 1 point as good as the 8 points it'll cost your opponent if you make them take it?

Azul - The Little Abstract That Could
August 30, 2018



Azul
Published by Plan B Games - 2017
Designer: Michael Kiesling
Head Artists: Philippe Guerin and Chris Quilliams
2 - 4 players ~ 30-45 minutes
Review written by Luke Muench

People are quick to assume that I fall under the ambiguous and recently somewhat negative label “hipster”. I tend to not like a wide variety of things the general public praises, actively fighting against any residual nostalgia fighting for air at the back on my mind, and I’m often asked why I can’t just “turn off my brain and enjoy stuff”.

In truth, I often wish I could find more joy out of the things others do; for one thing, it would mean I’d be a lot happier a lot more of the time. So it’s a pleasant surprise when a game like Azul comes along. While it’s monumental critical acclaim and 2018 Spiel de Jahres win does little to excite me (aside from a sort of minor-academic tickle), the brilliant game hidden within it’s glossy and colorful exterior deserves every bit of it’s acclaim. Azul is downright brilliant; elegant in function and hilarious fun in practice.

And no, I didn’t like it before it was cool.



… Is That It?

“I find your lack of faith disturbing.” - Darth Vader

Azul, in premise, is mind-numbingly simple; each round, you collect colored tiles to try and fill in the pattern on your board. On your turn, you’ll take all tiles of a single color from one of the circles on the table, pushing the remaining pieces to a central pool. Once you start filling a row with a specific color, you cannot fill it with any other color until it’s completed. If, at the end of a round, you have filled one of the left-most rows to capacity with a single color type, you get to place one of those tiles on the appropriate place on your pattern.

Abstract puzzling at its most banal? Yes, or at least it seems that way on the surface, with every review and picture online doing little to shake that impression. Yet as the praise kept pouring in, I felt it my duty to give it try, if only to have an excuse to talk some sense into the rambling masses. Surely there was some sort of drug coated across these little, shiny squares that had gotten into everyone’s blood-systems, surely there was a noxious gas hidden within each box, brainwashing anyone who dared open it, surely…

Only when you start to handle those tactile little pieces of plastic do you begin to grasp the true mastery and understanding of game design hidden within those cardboard player mats, for there is so much to grasp and grapple with turn to turn it will drive you batty. I don’t think I’ve won a single match of this game, yet I absolutely adore what it does.



Picking and Choosing

“All we have to decide is what to do with the time that is given us.” - Gandalf The Grey

Each decision in Azul impacts everyone at the table, creating a sort of rippling effect where actions have deeper, drawn out meanings that you may not see the full ramifications of until several turns later.

The first and most obvious decision is which color you choose to put where on your board. Do you think you can gather five of them this turn, or are you going to play it safe and just fill in your two-slot row now? Every row is a precision commodity, allowing you to harbor only so many of a given color, but they’re also a perilous restriction. The moment you place a red tile in a row, you are dedicating that row to red until it is completed. You better have a means of doing just that, or else you’re going to be seeing red for many turns to come as you rage over how you can’t just… I just want to put it… Come ON, why can’t I complete this freakin’ row?

The reason is because every other player is aware that you need those last 2 red tiles to get points for that row, and they just so happened to take them, even if it is a subpar move for them. Blocking other players is a huge part of how Azul is played; it’s a mean, cutthroat, often laugh-out-loud hilarious affair.

In one memorable game, I was awaiting my turn to scoop up the last blue tile I needed for my fifth row, which was going to score me a ton of points. As each player when about their business, a drop of sweat dripped from my brow in anticipation. It was only when my neighbor looked at my board did he decide to remove that precious commodity from the table. One. Turn. Before. Mine. And in that moment, I erupted in a flurry of heated exclamations too saucy to be repeated here. And I loved it, every second of it; this game made me feel that intense loss, and all because of the actions I had taken as well as those of my blood-thirsty opponents.



Easy Come, Easy Go

“You never know when some lunatic will come with a sadistic choice.” - The Green Goblin

But the truly evil, the most diabolical players, are those who orchestrate the massive loss of points possible in any given game.

There are two ways of losing points, the first of which may seem quite tame. As players take tiles, any leftovers are pushed to the aforementioned central pool, slowly building until one player can’t help but pull from the tantalizing pot of riches. When they do so, they also receive the first player marker, a prize that is promptly placed in the first of their negative points slots.

This does two things; firstly, it provides small but meaningful factor to consider as you play; will you sacrifice a point to go first next round?. And secondly, removing that first player token is like opening a floodgate, with the other players throwing themselves into that ocean of tiles, now freed from the threat of lost points. Quickly, this becomes a game of chicken as everyone sees how long they can wait before succumbing to the temptation of those five tiles of a kind while also recognizing that if the next player chooses to pull, you’re going last next round, an awful punishment in its own right.

The second and most damaging way of losing points is when, inevitably, players begin to pull tiles that they can’t legally place on their board anymore. In this case, any and all overflow tiles become negative points, splaying out on the bottom of your board like a line of bullet wounds. Take enough and you could lose up to negative fourteen points in a given round. In the immortal words of Phil Swift, “That’s a lotta damage!”

What’s more, forward-thinking players can begin to orchestrate such outcomes, so if you’re not careful, you could be stuck with a pile of eight tiles with no place to go. This past Origins, my buddy Quinn went from being in first place to just barely pulling up in third, as he was forced to take the full negative fourteen points in the final round of the game. It was hilarious, brutal, and engaging for everyone huddled around the table, desperately trying not to be the player who was bound to get skunked.



What’s The Score?

“If winning weren’t important, nobody would keep score.” Al McGuire

If there was one thing that could be defined as “complicated” in Azul, it would be scoring. At the end of each round when adding tiles to your pattern, each tile earns points equal to itself and any additional tiles in the same row and column. So while at the start of the game you’ll be earning single points, towards the end you’ll hopefully have orchestrated a board capable of forking over massive amounts of points.

Additionally, you’ll earn seven points for every completed column at the end of the game and ten points if you collected all five tiles of a given color. Lastly, a completed row will only earn you two points, but this is also the method of ending the game; the moment a single player completes a row, that means that the round you are playing will be the final round, leaving up to the players to determine how long a game will last.



A Winner, Through and Through

“The dude abides.” - The Dude

Azul is a beautiful game that anyone can pick up and play with ease, but with the design and choices that allow for competitive play. It has just enough player interaction to keep everyone on their toes, but each individual has their own little puzzle to solve. The flipside of the player boards, which removes the color restrictions of the boards, allows for some truly crazy and interesting plays, but can easily stump the unobservant player. It plays quickly and easily, facilitating some truly memorable experiences.

If ever there was a flaw, it would be that a single bump against your player board and all your progress can be flung across the room, which has happened to me once before. Yes, there are accessories to fix this, but it’s still an annoying quirk that can hamper your game.

Also, it should be noted that this isn’t the most color-blind friendly game out there, though replacement pieces have been released to better allow for anyone to tell the tiles apart. Still, someone shouldn’t have to pay additional money to play the same game as everyone else.

Yet if these are the only bad things I have to say about it, there must be something special about this compact, unassuming box full of gorgeous tiles and intense, unbridled emotion. Yes, for once the masses were right; Azul is a gem that should be in everyone’s collection. You win this one, society.

Who Should Get This Game: Anyone who can appreciate Azul’s smooth, seamless gameplay and the colorful style.

Who Shouldn’t Get This Game: Those who can’t stand a lack of theme or games that can be particularly mean at times. Hipsters.

Tema 367: Negative points
Pregunta:
Quick question about a situation that came up in a game last night. If I get a load of negative points in an early turn is it possible to have a negative score in azul? So if you have two points from the first round and get minus eight in the second round does your score go to zero or to negative six?

I thought you couldn't go below zero because the score track only goes to zero, there isn't any physical way to record a negative score in the game so I thought it must be intended not to be possible?

Anyone ever had this situation before?

The rules explicitly say:
M Stock
@rules
check if you have any tiles in your floor line. For each tile in your floor line, you lose the number of points indicated directly above it. Adjust your scoring marker on your score track accordingly (however, you can never drop below 0 points).

Respuesta 2:
Acording to rulebook:

Respuesta 3:
The only negative points I can think of, are the scoretracks themselves.



Tema 368: Rules read wrong: 5 tiles per factory - a bit friendlier variant
Pregunta:
Azul is a fantastic game which we played many (30 plus) times, mostly with two players.
But only recently, when I read the rules of Azul: Stained Glass of Sintra I found out that we have played it wrongly most of the times.

Each round, we places 5 tiles in stead of the correct 4 tiles per factory disk and we experienced Azul this as a very pleasant game.

Now we play it correctly with 4 tiles and it is more cut throat and more enjoyable.
Previously we had more tiles in the game and this way it mostly was a friendlier game.
But with five, it works and it works fine.

Respuesta 1:
I would think that more tiles would make it *more* cut throat in later rounds since people would more often be forced to take large batches of tiles that they couldn't place later in the round.

Respuesta 2:
Well..., in my opinion rules are made to be follow.
Even if don't read them, you see the factory offer setup image from the airplane.
Good luck.



Tema 369: Open variant clarification
Pregunta:
hello i have a question regarding the open board variant. What happens in situation from image below (number 1). Do i move four red tiles from the bottom row to the floor immediately after i finished row numer 4. or i move them to the floor only after i finished both of the rows (image number 2)

Hello
I have a question about tiles placement. Please help.
I have a case in the picture



If I take 4 black tiles in the middle of table and put it on my board. CAN I PUT IT AS IN PICTURE?


It means 1 tile in first line, 2 tiles on second line and 1 tile on fifth line.

OR
I must put all on fifth line if I dont want any tile going to FLOOR LINE.

Question is, in phase factory offer, after taking tiles, can I sêparate these tiles on different lines OR I have to put all to only 1 line and put the rest on the Floor line?

Thank in advance

Respuesta 1:
Option 2
All tiles must be put on the same line.
If you don’t have space they go on the floor causing you to have negative points
You can’t distribute tiles on different lines

Respuesta 2:
I've only played once but I think it has to go in one line, either empty or already containing the same colour, and not split between several lines.

Respuesta 3:
One line only. The rules are straightforward:

Take ALL tiles of ONE colour from one location. Obviously you must take at least one tile.

Place ALL of these tiles on ONE line on your board, spilling them onto the floor if necessary.

Respuesta 4:
All tiles picked once must be placed on the same line.

The quote below has the word "one" bolded, just as it is in the rules.

Then, add the tiles you picked to one of the 5 pattern lines on
your player board (the first line has 1 space to hold 1 tile, the fifth
line has 5).


This quote addresses the latter part of your question

If you have picked up
more tiles than you can place in your chosen pattern line, you
must place the excess tiles in the floor line (see Floor line).

Respuesta 6:
you could always make it as homerule to be able to add tiles anywhere. I was playing that way for a while until found out I missed that rule and it was still a fun game either way.

Whoops, been playing this wrong the whole time. That changes the difficulty level a bit. No wonder some of our games were so high scoring!



Tema 371: Player board orientation
Pregunta:
I suspect this is just a me issue but I always feel like the boards are oriented the wrong way when I play Azul.

Tema 374: [German] Azul Review
Pregunta:

https://spieltroll.de

Als ich Azul zum ersten mal sah, war ich total von seiner Optik und dem schönen Material begeistert, so sehr das ich es unbedingt haben musste. Das wiederum war gar nicht so einfach wie es klingt. Seitdem Azul auf der Spiele des Jahres Auswahlliste steht ist es überall ziemlich vergriffen und einige Händler verlangen Fantasiepreise für dieses außergewöhnliche Spiel. Nach längerer Suche ist es mir dann doch gelungen ein Exemplar zu einem vernünftigen Preis zu ergattern und ich nehme es an dieser Stelle schonmal vorweg, alles andere als die Auszeichnung zum Spiel des Jahres für Azul würde mich stark verwundern.

Aber fangen wir Vorne an. Azul ist ein Familienspiel für zwei bis vier Personen mit einer Spieldauer von einer halben bis dreiviertel Stunde. Die Regeln sind wirklich sehr überschaubar und schnell erklärt. Trotzdem ist es im Segment der Familienspiele eines das ein wenig mehr taktische Tiefe hat, als es im ersten Moment vermuten lässt.


Worum geht es?

Wir verkörpern quasi einen königlichen Fliesenleger der die Alhambra seines Herrschers mit schönen neuen Fliesen versehen soll. Das Muster ist je nach Variante des Spiels bereits vorgegeben oder wir dürfen es selber an die Wand bringen (dazu später mehr). Das anbringen der Fliesen an der Wand wird mit Punkten belohnt und wer das am besten meistert, der gewinnt diesen Wettstreit der Fliesenleger.

Wie läuft das Spiel ab?

Jeder Spieler erhält ein Tableau auf dem er seine Punkte zählen kann, auf dem sich seine zu fliesende Wand aus 5x5 Fliesen befindet und wo er das Fliesen in der sogenannten Musterphase planen muß. Der Startspieler bekommt auch noch eine besondere Fliese die bei Azul eine tatsächliche Rolle im Spiel einnimmt und nicht einfach nur blöde vor einem rumliegt, um anzuzeigen, dass man der erste in der Runde ist. In der Mitte des Tisches werden noch runde Manufakturplättchen, je nach Spieleranzahl zwischen fünf und neun Stück, aufgebaut auf denen jeweils vier Fliesensteine platziert werden.


Wenn ein Spieler an die Reihe kommt darf er sich nun für eine Fliesensorte (es gibt fünf verschiedene) von einem der Plättchen entscheiden und nimmt sich sämtliche Fliesensteine dieser Sorte. Alle übrigen Fliesen von diesem Plättchen werden nun in die Mitte gelegt. Alle Spieler nach dem ersten haben nun die Wahl, ob sie eine Sorte Fliesen von einem der übrigen Plättchen nehmen oder sich für eine der Sorten aus der Mitte entscheiden. Der Startspieler legt seine Startfliese zusätzlich als erstes in die Mitte bevor er sich für eine Sorte von einem Plättchen entscheidet und der Spieler, der sich als erstes für eine Sorte aus der Mitte und nicht von den Plättchen entscheidet, muß auch zusätzlich die Startspielerfliese an sich nehmen. Was macht man nun mit den Fliesensteinen? Ganz einfach, man legt sie auf sein Tableau in den Musterbereich. Dieser besteht aus fünf Reihen die von oben nach unten immer länger werden. Die oberste besteht nur aus einem Feld in das man eine Fliese legen kann, die anderen dann immer aus jeweils einem Feld mehr. Ganz unten auf dem Tableau befindet sich noch eine weitere Reihe mit insgesamt sieben Feldern, die sogenannte Bodenreihe. Man darf in einer Reihe mit Ausnahme der Bodenreihe immer nur Fliesen einer Sorte ablegen. Wenn man die Startspielerfliese genommen hat, muss man sie in die Bodenreihe platzieren.

Wie macht man nun Punkte? Wenn alle Spieler ihre Fliesen platziert haben beginnt die nächste Phase in der man die Fliesen nun an seine Wand anbringt. Diese Phase können alle Spieler im Prinzip gleichzeitig absolvieren. Man geht seine Musterreihen von oben nach unten durch und aus jeder die komplett ist entfernt man die am weitesten rechte und legt sie in seinen Wandbereich. Bildet man dabei horizontale und vertikale längere Reihen macht man mehr Punkte. Reihen in den nun ganz rechts keine Fliesen mehr liegen werden genauso wie die Bodenreihe komplett abgeräumt.

Man spielt solange bis ein Spieler auf seiner Wand eine horizontale Fliesenreihe komplett hat. Die Runde wird noch beendet und danach ein Sieger durch Punkte ermittelt. Am Ende bekommt man noch Sonderpunkte für horizontal und vertikal komplette Reihen, sowie für eine komplett an die Wand gebrachte Fliesensorte.

Der Mechanismus erfordert bereits bei der Auswahl der Fliesen eine tiefergehende Vorausplanung, weil nicht nur die Art der Fliese, sondern auch die Position an der Wand, sowie auch die Reihenfolge des Einsetzens an die Wand entscheidend ist. Das führt dann tatsächlich zu einem erstaunlich taktischem Spiel, wass man im ersten Moment nicht so erwartet hätte. Wer genug von dem vorgegebenen muster hat, kann das Tableau umdrehen und findet eine Seite ohne Muster vor, auf der man dann soagar noch mehr planen muss, da pro Reihe und Spalte des Musters jede Fliese wie bei einem Sudoku nur einmal vorkammen darf.

Für die Trollfamilie also genau das richtige Spiel, nicht zu seicht und mit einem guten Mechanismus und wirklich wunderschönem Spielmaterial ausgestattet. Auch sehr gut als Zweipersonenspiel geeignet.

Tema 375: BoardGame Generations — Azul
Pregunta:
Azul

I haven't won a game of Azul. I don't know why. This Spiel des Jahres winner should be squarely in my wheelhouse: simple mechanisms underpinned by complex decisions, long term planning balanced with short term tactics, and light player interaction. Alas, I haven't synthesized these elements. Am I overthinking Azul? Is this a game best approached as a light gateway experience? Or are there hidden depths I've not yet explored?

In Azul, I'm making sets of 1 - 5 tiles. On my turn I pick the tiles I want from "factories" — card board disks holding 4 random tiles. I select all tiles of one type from the factory. The remaining tiles go into a central pool. I place my selected tiles on my player board, making sets. Such simple rules, is there really a game here?

These simple actions contain many choices. The first choice is which set of tiles I want. There is the obvious choice: taking the largest group available. On my first turn, one of the factories has 3 red tiles. I can simply take these tiles and complete my set of 3. Done and dusted. But what about that lone blue tile. It will be placed in the centre. Maybe each of the 5 factories also has a single blue tile. And maybe in a few turns there will be 5 blue tiles sitting in the centre, just ripe for collecting on another turn.

But what if I don't take the obvious group. What if I take the single blue tile and put the red tiles in the centre? The first player taking tiles from the centre will also take next round’s first player marker. This marker will loose them a point at this round's end. If I put those 3 red tiles in the centre right away, maybe they will tempt my Mom. She'll also loose a point this round, but I'll now have free choice from the centre. However, I don't think I should risk it. The 3 red tiles will at least complete a set and score me one point.

My Mom and son take their turns and, as I thought, have also taken the remaining tile pairs. All of those single blue tiles are discarded into the centre. Taking those blue tiles is so tempting. They probably won't last another turn around the table. I really should take them, but I'll draw first from the centre, losing a point. Also, since I already played a set of 3 red tiles, I can't play the blue tiles as a set of 3. I could play them as a set of 2, dropping the extra third blue tile "on the floor" (I must take all of the same colour, I can't take just 2 of the 3 blue tiles) losing another point. Or I can start working towards a set of 4 or 5. There are still 2 blue tiles out there. I could put the blue tiles in my 5 set spot and hope I get the other 2. But my son could simply take one blue tile, playing it in his 1-set slot, and deny me my set. So instead I take the 3 blue tiles and play them in my 4-set slot. That should be safe.

On her next turn, my Mom puts another blue tile in the centre. If I'm lucky, there will just be that lone blue tile that I can take on my next turn. But then my son, grinning from ear to ear, takes a couple of tiles from the last factory and places a second blue tile in the centre. If I take the 2 blue tiles, I'll have to drop one and lose a point. I could let my incomplete set of blue tiles carry over to the next round where I'm sure to pick up another one. In hindsight, I knew this play was risky. I take the 2 blue tiles and instead play them in my 2-set slot.

(The bakelite tiles look and feel great.)

Just in the opening round, there are so many great mechanisms. First, Azul feels very similar to worker placement games. Each factory will have tiles I want, but I have to pick them first from the factory. If someone else goes there, even if they don't take my tiles, I can't visit that factory later. In this way, Azul captures so well the central idea of worker placement games — prioritizing which resources I want most — without the complexity of workers. Even how first player is decided feels like a worker placement game. If I visit the centre first I get the first player tile for next round, but with the penalty that I lose a point. This trade off becomes more and more important as the game progresses. I might even visit the centre in my opening turn just so I can be first the following round.

Next is the I-split-you-choose mechanism. Taking the tiles I want from a factory splits the lot, sending the remainders to the centre pool. In splitting the lot I must decide if I can afford to make the remainders available to everyone else. While I may split them in a way that favours me, I could inadvertently make a set that really benefits my opponent. Just like the best I-split-you-choose games, I'm weighing the costs of the split. Is what I'm giving up worth what I'm taking? Should I split the factory differently, taking a set that is worth less to me but leaves little my opponents can use? Every turn I take, I'm trading off what I gain against what my opponents gain — love it!

Finally, the centre pool introduces a great push-your-luck aspect. Before the round ends, every tile must be chosen. This means one colour tile may accumulate in the centre, becoming larger and larger. Someone must eventually take that large group. If it is me, maybe I have no place for those tiles on my board. I'll “drop” tiles, loosing points when the round is scored. When tiles start piling up, do I spend a turn taking those tiles while I can play them, sacrificing other opportunities? Or do I let it ride, hoping more tiles don't pile up. As the round winds down, it becomes more and more obvious who will end up taking the last group of tiles. Can I sacrifice a few points here and stick my Mom with a larger group she can't use? If the last player will be me, is there a way I can influence the outcome — maybe leaving tiles I know my Mom and son will want — and minimize my potential damage. This little twist turns what could have been an on-rails round end (we all just hoover up the remaining tiles) into a tense finish.

If Azul stopped there, just a series of set-collecting rounds, it would be a great game. But Azul goes a small step further. At the end of the round, a tile from each complete set is placed permanently on my player board. When I score my set of 3 red tiles, I place one red tile in the row corresponding to the 3-set spot. Now in further rounds, I can't collect another set of 3 red tiles. I must collect a different set. As more and more rounds progress, my set collecting options shrink, making the game harder. I must carefully plan my turns, gaining the tiles I can use while keeping useful tiles from the others.

I'm first player at the start of the next round. Once again, there are 3 red tiles in one factory. Taking those tiles and scoring my 3-set would be wonderful, but I have already used red tiles there. I could leave them for another player, but that's just giving someone else a good set of tiles. The odd tile out is black. If I take the black tile, then the 3 red tiles go to the centre. A player taking that set will also need to accept the first player token along with the negative point — a fair trade-off. What could I use the black tile for? I check how many black tiles are in play. Are there enough to build a bigger set of 5? In this round there are only 2 black tiles (including the one I'm currently thinking about). Do I think I can get the second black tile? Probably not. I'm sure my Mom will take the 3 red tiles from the centre, but there isn't much left for my son. He might as well take the black tile just to slow me down.

I could take the black tile as my 1-set. Another option is starting in on the 5 set row this turn. I'll likely get the second black tile in play this round (another player now has little incentive stealing it from me). And with so few black tiles in play this round, there is a good chance I'll have plenty of black tiles next round. That will also save my 1-set row for another single tile I’m forced to pick up.

And so the decision space closes down, round after round. By the 5th round, I absolutely need a set of 2 blacks — and only 2 blacks. No other colour will work. My Mom’s decision space is similarly restricted, only she needs exactly 2 reds. No factories have 2-blacks, so I'll have to collect them over at least 2 turns. But one factory has 2 red tiles. I could take those tiles and place them in my 5-set row. I probably won't complete that set — the game ends when one player has placed each of the 5 colours permanently in one row of their player board. When I complete the black pair this round, I'll have my last colour in the 2-row. But taking the pair of reds would prevent my Mom from completing her 2-row — a nice defensive move!

I really like how cut-throat Azul can get near the end. In the final round, with only a few viable colour sets, play deftly shifts from "what is best for me" to "what is worst for my opponents". I think one reason I have such trouble winning Azul is that I don't make this shift. Even in the last round, I'm still eking out an extra set or 2 on my board instead of hurting my opponents.

(From the sturdy cardboard player boards and factories, to the durable cotton bag, Azuls' components are top notch.)

One thing I don't like about Azul is the scoring. Each round when I place a tile permanently on my board, I score a point for each connected tile horizontally and vertically. I find this scoring hard to teach and at odds with the beautiful simplicity of the core mechanisms. Sure, I understand and appreciate that this scoring encourages even more planning. I'll look for colour sets that nicely fit amidst the tiles I've already placed. So if I have a choice between a blue or red set, I might choose the blue because it will score me more points.

But Azul doesn't gain much from this additional complexity. The game already has so many choices elegantly wrapped up in its simple rules. Adding spatial planning into the mix doesn't really develop deeper decisions. Instead, it brings attention to the underlying randomness of the game, an aspect that up to this point had been well hidden. I may have masterfully placed my tiles in rounds 1 through 4, creating the perfect situation for scoring a whopping 9 points in round 5. But the one colour I need for that perfect 3-set doesn't materialize. Only 2 tiles of that colour come up in the round. No matter how skilled I am, I can't make the play work. Instead I build a set of different colours, losing out on that high score. I could still make that play the following round — if there is another round. It's a bit frustrating when the winning play comes down to draws from the bag.

On the other hand, there will be rounds where all of the right colours just appear. Not only am I easily making many sets, they all make high scoring plays for me. There was no planning, no strategy, just luck. Worse is when my son has been making whatever random sets he can. And then at the end of a round, suddenly colours fill in the right spots and he reaps a bountiful score. Seeing chains of points happen in the later rounds is a great feeling and I think a large appeal for new gamers. That those chains can happen somewhat randomly is disappointing.

There is an advanced variant in which I decide where each colour goes. This takes out much of the randomness and eliminates my complaint. But this variant adds so much more cognitive load that new players have a hard time planning and experienced players may shut down completely from analysis paralysis! My preference would have been simplifying or eliminating the chain scoring, minimizing some of the randomness.

Azul packs so many interesting decisions into a really simple rule set. A healthy dose of randomness in the tile distribution keeps experienced players from steamrolling the inexperienced. Definitely a great gateway game, Azul really rewards identifying immediate gains over long term strategy. Mid and end game scoring combos makes the game exciting for everyone, but does so by slightly favouring luck over in-depth analysis. Azul never gets too analytical — a great game for introducing new gamers that is still deep enough for those well steeped in the hobby.

Tema 376: Putting the tiles back in the bag after every round
Pregunta:
I just started playing this and assumed you put all the reject tiles back in the bag after each round. Anyone else do / done this? I've not yet played it the correct way, IE putting them in the lid after each round then only putting them back in the bag when the bag is empty. Just interested to know other peoples experiences.

Respuesta 1:
You should only put tiles back in the bag when there are still more rounds but the bag is empty and it needs to be refilled. Once the bag is empty, it's usually just in time for the round to be the last one.

You would like equal distribution of tiles so hold until the bag is empty

Respuesta 3:
Read carefully the rulebook before starting the game.

Respuesta 4:
Putting them back in the bag changes the chances of getting any particular colour. If, say, most blue tiles come out early, someone sweating on blue to complete a row will have a much better chance if the tiles are returned.

One tip I have seen, but not yet put into practice, is to use two bags. Return them to the second bag, then when the first is empty, simply swap bags. This will keep the tile distribution as intended, but simplify the changeover when the draw bag is empty.

Respuesta 5:
Oh man, playing with you would kill my strategy! I count the tiles that have come out and plan ahead for the ones still in the bag! You would kill my game!

We use an "Azul bowl" instead of the box top.

Easier to pour the tiles into the bag when the time comes.

And when the tiles are put into the ceramic bowl, they make a pleasing sound.

Yes because tiles that have been discarded might affect your strategy - if you're hoping to fill the bottom row it's less of a challenge if all the tiles are back in the bag. If you have to wait for the colour you want to come back you have to plan how you'll do what you want.

We use a little wooden bowl my dad made.

We use a Solo Cup.

We have some left over from a party that are the same color as the plastic Azul insert....pretty!

The height works well as tiles inside can't be seen by players.

Our game is played so often we keep the cup upside down and double rubber banded on top of the lid. I know....NOT the best for storage issues.

Put them on a smooth flat surface. Ideally one at a time but otherwise make sure they're stacked tightly flush with each other. You might like to slip a sheet of acid free paper between each. Get a large smooth flat object that's bigger than them and place it on top. Anything is fine. Big book or tray or just a piece of board. Needs to be rigid but doesn't have to be heavy. Then stack heavy items on top of that. Books are great. Bricks. Weights. Anything heavy. Leave for as long as you can. Take care unstacking in case they've stuck together.



Tema 379: Is this game really appealing to kids?
Pregunta:
Hi.

We are a 4 member family (kids are 8 & 12 years old).

From our game collection kids favorites are Stone Age, Istanbul, Ticket to Ride: Europe, Raiders of the North Sea, 7 Wonders.

On the other hand a game they especially dislike and find it very boring (so do i) is Splendor.

I want to buy us a new game and considering also kids preferences, among other games i have in mind like Clank!: A Deck-Building Adventure or Small World, i m also curious if Azul is a good option.

Mostly i m concerned if Azul is a bit boring compared to my kids favorite games, as it has more "serious" theme, board and components than the above games. That's why i want to ask if anyone can tell if his kids finds the game attractive or not.

Whats your opinion? Do you think it will be a suitable choice as a family game and a fine addition to our collection or should i go with a game like Clank!: A Deck-Building Adventure or Small World etc?

Thank you!

Respuesta 1:
The theme is pretty weak in Azul but accounts for the great colourful components. I think it depends on your children really and you will know their tastes best. Azul is a clever game but not sure if all children would appreciate this- neither would all adults. I suppose you could always play it two player with your partner if the children don't 'get it' right away and in a couple of years it may be more in their wheelhouse.

Respuesta 2:
My 7-year-old daughter enjoys Azul. She enjoys the look and feel of the pieces, but more importantly, she enjoys trying to build out her grid of tiles to maximize points. She doesn't do the cutthroat bit of taking tiles out of spite, but she will do all she can to ensure that she get multiple sets of five.

As was mentioned, you know your children best. If they enjoy abstract thinking and themes, this might be a winner for them.

Your mileage may vary. I love Azul and my nephew (who is a bit younger than your youngest) loves games like Azul (and games like   or games in the  ) with chunky and unusual/colorful components, but he tends to be bored by games that are more story-driven or thematic.

Based on what you're saying, I am guessing Azul might not be for your family. Azul is closer to Splendor than any of the other games you listed, in my opinion.

ITs tough to recommend it based on what you’ve mentioned. It’s a great game but it’s a “thinky” abstract kind of game. There is good interaction based on the fact that everyone is grabbing tiles from a main pool, and it’s very clever and it makes you feel clever once you’re playing it and seeing all the moves you can make.

I know many kids that love the game, butt there’s also many kids that hate it, It’s too “thinky” for them and not exciting enough.

If your kids like thinky tactic/strategy abstract style games. Then yes.

If they enjoy the ticket to ride interaction of “blocking” each other’s tracks. I think they would enjoy azul’s interaction, because essentially you can block someone from getting the tiles they need (I wouldn’t say it’s mean though, because if you play mean then you won’t get the tiles you actually need and end up losing). Then yes.

But again, this is all guesses.

Respuesta 12:
Azul has been a hit with my daughter and her cousin (both 7). They're not yet able to form a strategy, but they really enjoy the mechanics so long as they don't lose too devastatingly. As far as I can tell, no-one has been tempted to eat the pieces, except me.

To your other points, Clank has too much reading for our 7yo's though the Dragon meeple makes fantastic noises. Small World worked well.

Respuesta 13:
based on your post and the responses, I'd say pick a different one. my kids love it and so do we, but also love splendor. kind of sounds like they go hand in hand, i.e. they won't like this one either.

Tema 382: Azul: Five Plays in 2018
Pregunta:
Envy is a hell of a drug. You see, the king of Portugal, King Manuel I, recently visited the Alhambra Palace of southern Spain and was completely enraptured by the beautiful decorative tiles that adorned its walls. And now he’s ordering that his own Portuguese palace be decorated with similar azul wall tiles. So, which of you is going to create the best god**** tile wall the king has ever seen? Who’s going to solidify your place as the greatest m*********ing artist in the world?

*cue explosions and sunglasses*

Okay, so my description of Azul might be a little over the top. I had to spice it up a bit, because the theme of the game is so inconsequential to what is actually important – gawking over those beautiful, chunky resin tiles and admiring your artistic handiwork.

Azul was the first game of my 20×5 Challenge to be completed. It’s no surprise – Azul was a hot title upon its release in late 2017 (and easily ranked high on my personal top 10 of the year), and it continues to draw attention several months later. The gorgeous tiles and colorful player boards command attention and always draw lookie-loos when played in public spaces. And the wonderful accessibility of the gameplay makes it an easy recommendation to new gamers.

But how does that simplicity translate to repeated plays?

Five plays of Azul in 2018



Surprisingly well, in fact. As of January 1, 2018, I’ve clocked in 10 plays of Azul (which is twice the amount I needed for this challenge.) Since its release last October, I have logged a total of 15 plays. That doesn’t happen very frequently for most games, let alone new titles . Obviously there’s something about Azul that has brought it to the table often. The majority of sessions involved teaching the game to new players, which is common with new releases. The uncommon aspect though is how frequently new players would run away with the victory, proving just how accessible Azul can be to all types of tabletop gamers.

Because of the randomized nature of tile distribution every game, there’s no way to play things out exactly the same each time. I’ve developed a strategy that I tend to stick to – cluster tiles on your board together as early as possible to multiply your scoring potential – but even that can run into roadblocks depending on the actions of other players.

This is a wonderful problem for any game to have. I shouldn’t be able to solve Azul, and thankfully there doesn’t seem to be a way to consistently do so. I can walk into any game with a game plan, but I’m forced to adapt and react to a number of factors – the tiles that others are gunning for, the tiles that are abundant or scarce each round, and even what number in the turn order I am. And because a session of Azul is so brisk, I never feel like my time was wasted if I end up completely bombing due to poor wall planning.

A follow-up to Azul was recently announced – Azul: Stained Glass of Sintra. While my curiosity is piqued, I’m also thoroughly happy with Azul as it is. I plan on taking a break from hauling it to game nights for a bit. But I have complete confidence that Azul will continue to find its way to my table for a long time to come.

And now, some statistics (because stats are awesome)

- The majority of plays involved 4-players.
- The average score for all players is 68.
- The highest score is 90 (achieved by two different players!)
- The average winning score is 81.
- My personal highest score is 72.
- The lowest winning score is 70.

Tema 383: Full Variable Turn Order for 3p and 4p
Pregunta:
Full Variable Turn Order for Azul 3p and 4p:

Draw out a random tile for each player as their base color tile to place on the corner of their board. This will also lower the ratios of those colors and make them more difficult to place. If you wish to keep the same ratios of tiles then substitute some type of colored paper, cardboard, wooden/plastic meeples, dice, etc from something else in blue, red, black, white, and yellow to place on your player boards instead.

Mock up a Variable turn order card with 2 columns (current round and next round). Please note that these are suggested starting values subject to more playtesting.
1st player is -1vp.
2nd player is -1vp.
3rd player is +0vp.
4th player is +1vp.

For the 1st round draw out tiles until you take a player's tile to set on the turn order card. There are no vp adjustments for the 1st round. Return any extra tiles to the bag.

During play...

The 1st player tile will still be in the middle. The 1st player for the next round will be the player who takes the standard 1st player tile from the middle. This will now give them a net of -2vp instead of just -1vp. This player places their color tile from their board on the turn order card in 1st for the next round.

To be the 2nd player in the next round a player must now be the first to select their color tiles from anywhere (factory or middle). They place the tile from their board on the turn order card for -1vp.

The 3rd player will then be the next to select their color tiles from anywhere and places the color tile from their board on the turn order card. Once the 3rd player selects their tiles, the 4th player is set, and places their tile on the 4th spot and will receive +1vp during scoring.

In the event that players are unable to draft their color tiles or choose not to then remaining players will be placed clockwise in even rounds and counter-clockwise in odd rounds from the last player on the turn order card.

Once the round and scoring adjustments for the turn order of the next round is completed, players take their tiles from the just completed round turn order and place them on their board to use during the next round.

Respuesta 1:
Not sure I follow this.

Are you saying that the player color indicates the required color to draft in order to be the 2nd, 3rd, 4th player?

If someone else chooses, say blue, then the blue player won't be able to grab position? I'm guessing no, but your wording needs some work.

I guess you mean the 1st player to draft their own color tile will be 2nd player. The 2nd player to do this is the 3rd player?

Also, why the new mechanism for assigning color and requiring that to be what indicates turn order? What problem is this solving for you? It seems to me that this will direct players towards that color, which limits the strategic/tactical space. Not sure, maybe it doesn't, but this system seems a bit odd to me.

I guess what I'm getting at is that you are introducing a significant new mechanism that will have a lot of impact, and I'm not sure what problem it's solving. Seems like this variant would require a TON of play testing.

If I wanted to shake up player order more than the alternating direction solution (the thread you commented in recently) I'd probably just use a turn order track and have player order stay static... except that whoever grabs the 1st player token moves to the start of the track, pushing everyone back. That incentivizes grabbing the 1st player tile, is much less complicated and will tend to shift player order around, but in a more controlled way that you can plan around.

Just my initial off-the-cuff thoughts...

Respuesta 2:
I made a few edits.

It's possible that it could change the strategic space. I agree that it could make it slightly more restrictive, but at the same time slightly more tactical.

Do you draft your color right away to grab 2nd turn? Where do you save the space on your board to do this?

Do you draft another player's color such that they have no good way to grab 2nd in turn order so that they get 4th?

Alternating player direction is better than standard player direction for sure and is simpler. I also have played a lot of VTO type games (Terra Mystica, Gaia Project, Castles of Burgundy), and I usually enjoy this addition to the strategic space. Some games also have a mix of standard and VTO in 2 different phases such as Roll Player.

This would probably be a good addition that some of my heavy/long game friends would probably like for Azul. In my area we have some Meetups for game days on a Sat, Sun or holiday where some people are playing a 2hr game and others are playing a 3hr game. This is one of the more frequent games that is played while waiting on another game to finish for the heavy/long crowd. It is also a terrific game for the lighter game crowds that I go to as well.

I disagree that it would require a lot of playtesting... by humans. An AI for Azul would quickly be able to determine what the vp values on a turn order card should be. I know an extremely good AI programmer.

Respuesta 3:
There's more than the VP values to be determined.

The primary issue I see is that it incentivizes going for "your" color as early as possible each round. That greatly changes the flow of the game. That's where you'd need to see the play testing.

Respuesta 4:
You actually won't want to go for your color until after the 1st player tile is taken. Also, everyone else might also go for their color. However, doing this could also be a suboptimal play if they haven't properly planned for it.



Tema 384: Evolving strategy after three games
Pregunta:
I had asked Don to buy this game for me, and I paid him $50 for it. He had read the rules and taught the rules to Greg, Trevor and I.

Game 1: I figured since the scoring is chained off earlier blocks, I would try to fill the blue tile in the middle as that would give one the most scoring options, as you can build on either side, rather than be restricted with a column against the side of the board. I think Greg was thinking the same thing as he was trying to fill three blue on the third row as well.

In this game, it seems everyone was playing not to take a big floor loss. I was playing to maximize my score and worry about the floor loss towards the end of the round. We were seated Greg, Trevor, Don and myself around the table, and weren’t quite thinking yet of trying to screw anyone.

It turned out to be a tight game, 6 pts separating the first and last. Don and I actually tied, but since I had two horizontal lines, I won by a tiebreaker.

Scores:
Norbert 66 (45+ 4( two horizontal lines)+ 7 (vertical)+ 10 (five of one color)),
Don 66 (57 + 2 horizontal line, + 7 veritcal),
Greg 62 (48 + 14 two vertical lines),
Trevor 60 (46 + 14 two vertical lines)

Game 2: With one game of experience under our belt, people were looking further ahead to see if people could be forced to take a lot of tiles on the floor. I was getting a grasp that getting tiles onto your board gives more scoring opportunities than trying to avoid taking floor losses. So I still built down the middle, and Greg was doing the same thing.

Trevor was able to trigger an ending where I took a 10 pt hit or so on the floor. But using the principle that cubes on the mat were better than trying to avoid losses, I squeaked out another win, this time over Greg. Trevor had used 5 turns to end this game quickly on the top row.

Scores:
Norbert 57 (43 + 14 two vertical),
Greg 54 (40+ 14 (two vertical)),
Trevor 25 (23, 2 horizontal),
Don 24 (17 + 7 vertical)




My board with the cubes in the middle, giving me more scoring options.

Game 3: Greg went on a strategy to just focus on getting five of a kind and not worry about vertical or horizontal ines. I wasn’t sure this would work, as it would require a longer game to achieve this. But a longer game ensued, when Don took one for the team, eating 10 pts on the floor, so I could lose something like 12 pts. Don remarked he had taken me down with him.

Even then, I still had a chance, but Greg actually got three colors with five cubes!

Scores:
Greg 74 (44 + 30 three colors with five cubes),
Norbert 52 (25 + 20 (two colors with five), + 7 vertical line),
Trevor 54 (35 + 10 (one color with five), + 7 vertical + 2 horizontal), Don ~20 (3 + 10 one color with five, 7 vertical).


Greg's board with three colors with five cubes - very well played!

Notes: Don is color blind, but he missed a couple of times of putting the a symbol cube on the wrong symbol. But we didn’t catch it until later the mistake was made, hence the approximate score for Don.
I enjoyed my first few playing of this. I’d like to see what we learn in future games.

Respuesta 1:
We've played Azul dozens of times with 2-, 3-, and 4-players, and we learned that it gets very tactical. It's a great game that rewards planning ahead.

Tema 387: End game bonus 10 point scoring unclear
Pregunta:
Can anybody explain this? Don't understand the rules as printed or the graphic with the 5 equals symbols around the 10 points on the player board.

Respuesta 1:
If you are successful in placing all 5 of the tiles of a specific color you get 10 points.

Respuesta 2:
Also, you can score multiple color bonuses if you complete all of the tiles for more than one color (e.g. 10 points for all of the black, and 10 more points for all of the dark blue).

Edit: Ninja entry right above me as I was typing.

Simple sentence of explanation from the End of the Game section in the rules.

* Gain 10 points for each color of which you have placed all 5 tiles on your wall.

And that does work multiple times, for those rare times when your opponents let you get away with it, you score 10 points for EACH color in which you have all 5 tiles coverd (just like you would score 7 for each column, 2 for each row).

Tema 388: Board Gaming with Helena (s1e13): Azul
Pregunta:
The Intro
With the recent announcement of the winners of the Spiel Des Jahre 2018, I decided to bring Azul to our next meeting.



The Information
In Azul, players take on the role of a tile-laying artist tasked with decorating the walls of the Portuguese Royal Palace of Evora. Players are given a player board with a Score Track at the top, Pattern Lines to the left, a Wall to the right and a Floor Line on the bottom. There will be a circle of Factory Displays that have four randomly drawn tiles on each and a start player tile in the center of the circle of Displays. On a players turn they will either pick all of the tiles of the same color from one of the Factory Displays or will pick all the tiles of the same color from the center of the circle. The first player to take tiles from the center of the circle will also take the start player tile and will be the first player in the next round. The chosen tiles will then be placed on one of their five pattern lines. Tiles of the same color can only be added onto the same Pattern Line. If the number of spaces on a Pattern Line are filled, then the excess tiles fall to the Floor Line and will bring the player negative points when scoring. The start player tile is also placed on the Floor Line. You cannot place tiles on a Pattern Line if you have a tile of that color already on the wall in that line. Once all the Factory displays have been emptied and all the tiles have been selected from the center of the circle, tiles are placed onto the Wall by taking the rightmost tile from each completed Pattern Line and placing it onto the Wall and scoring. When scoring, players score each tile linked horizontally with the newly placed tile, including the newly place tile itself, then score each vertically linked tile. Any unfinished Pattern Lines are left for the next round, all leftover tiles from completed Pattern Lines are returned to the bag. Negative points are scored from the Floor Line and the tiles are returned to the bag with the starting player tile being placed back in the center of the circle. The end of the game is triggered once an entire row of a wall has been completed, then the current round is played to finish and a final scoring takes place in which points are awarded for completed rows and completed columns as well as the completing of all five tiles of a single color placed on the Wall. The player with the most points wins.

The Feedback
The game production is captivating and she was extremely impressed with the beautiful box design to the colorful and intricate tile pieces as well as the easy to understand boards and the short and clear rule book. Everything looked great and had her very interested in playing.

The Experience
We went over the gameplay and the conditions for winning and scoring points and within a few minutes we were selecting our first set of tiles. Helena grabbed three red tiles and placed them in the three spaces of her third Pattern Line. I grabbed two of the light blue tiles and placed them in the fourth row. We continued grabbing tiles and Helena was the first to take tiles from the center and so she placed the starting player tile in her Floor Line on the first available space which would give her -1 point at the end of the scoring phase. When the first round ended Helena had a light blue with the white pattern in row one of her wall, a black piece in row two and a red piece in row three while working towards her blue on the fifth row. She had score 1 point then 2 points and finally 3 points before losing 1 point. On we went picking up and placing tiles until I got stuck with five red tiles and no where to put them and so they dropped to the Floor Line that scored me -8 points at the end of the scoring phase. Finally, Helena finished one of her rows and the end game was triggered, I was able to finish a second column but not a second color while she was able to do both and come away with a pretty comfortable victory.

The Reaction
She really enjoyed this game. The game is wonderfully produced but the decisions the game presents are challenging in what is relatively a simple game. You pick tiles and places tiles but how you do so and how you play with what is available is critically important and an aspect she really loved. It’s clever and quick and a little cutthroat. Helena leaving those red tiles that she could have used knowing that it would cause me to lose eight points instead of her gaining two points was a ruthless move that would upset some gamers but I smirked that she saw the game in that way and took advantage of it.

The Critique
It can be a little random and the draw of the tiles can lead to heartbreak when the hopeful groupings of blue tiles you desperately need are not pulled from the bag and you are left with a gaping hole in your planned moves for that round. It does seem like it could get a little repetitive pretty quick but the other side of the board has an interesting variant with a totally blank wall for players to create their own patterns adhering to certain rules.

The Evaluation
Helena loves Azul. It has quickly moved up to #2 on her top three list of games. The strategic selection of tiles to build your layout and score points is slightly tense and a lot of fun. It plays quickly and has a vibrant aesthetic that makes her feel happy while playing. Sean really enjoys Azul as well. He particularly likes that the game plays fast so that you can get in another game or two when you have had a particularly bad game where nothing seemed to break your way. Very addictive.

The Grades
Helena gives Azul an A with a congratulations for winning the Spiel Des Jahres here in 2018 and Sean gives the game a solid B+ for being a well done and simple game that deserves the accolades and attention it has received. Bravo.

Tema 389: Variant lock up. When to choose what tiles go to the floor.
Pregunta:
Image courtesy bridgetvh

In this picture, it is obvious that the first and fourth rows cannot both be advanced in the wall-tiling phase. One of them has to go. Now, the variant rules state that when this happens, a tile that cannot move over must go, with all its other tiles, to the floor. That's a given. The question is which row gets to drop to the floor.

Obviously, the player would prefer to send the singleton down to the floor rather than the row of 4 tiles (unless their desire is to end the game), but we've got two different ideas on what should happen.

1) [The 'floor line' interpretation] Some say that since the "Floor Line" paragraph is separate from the movement rules that you can at any time before wall-tiling decide "not to place" so that you could drop that nasty 4 to the floor before wall-tiling commences.

2) [The 'order of placement' interpretation] Others say that you screwed up and cannot rely on the 'floor line' clause and must start placing from top to bottom, meaning you place that singleton and the 4 others fall to the floor.

I can see it either way since this wasn't explicitly stated in the variant rules and you can't always rely on another partially unrelated rule to govern.

Has the designer ever chimed in on this condition?

Note that if the answer is #1, where you can choose to drop stuff to the floor, with penalty, before wall-tiling, this opens up many options in the regular game as well. For instance, if you have 3 out of 4 completed at the end of a round and you don't want to lock in that 4 row with that particular tile all of next round, just take the penalty and drop them to the floor so you can start anew with row 4 in the next round.

FWIW that seems a bizarre interpretation to me. You already placed them. I can't see any reason to think that you can later retroactively decide not to "place" the tiles which you already decided to place and already placed.

I see no reason to think that, in the variant, the wall-tiling phase doesn't work as it is described, i.e. top to bottom.

The variant doesn't say to do it differently, so why assume that it could be done differently?

Respuesta 2:
I would always go with order of placement. You move the tiles from top to bottom. Since there is no special mention to any different placement rules in the variant board, the general rules apply.
So in that case, the tiles in the 4th row would go to the floor.

You shouldn't have gotten to this state to begin with because you're placing tiles on the left illegally.

This is something you need to watch for while playing. But should you accidentally end up in this position due to poor planning and not noticing it, I'd say you suffer the more severe penalty. My reasoning is, you shouldn't have been allowed to draft both sets of tiles to begin with because it's not legal.

It's an extension of the rule:

In all later rounds, you must also comply with the following rule: You are not allowed to place tiles of a certain color in a pattern line whose corresponding line of your wall already holds a tile of that color.

Combined with the Variant rule:
However, as the game progresses, in each of the 5 vertical lines of your wall, no color may appear more than once.

And while you don't technically haven't broken those rules in the picture, you're going to because of how you've drafted.

Respuesta 4:
The reason you can't "go with the order of placement rules" in the variant is because you are prohibited from doing what appears in the picture above. Either one of those rows would not have allowed placement in the first place or both would have red spots still available for wall-tiling.

You couldn't have gotten to this position. Now that you're in it, the question is not resolved except to say that something has to go away. The question is whether that's before you start wall-tiling or after you start (which would then be in order of top to bottom).

Of course, this player could have had absolutely nothing but the four reds in a row (taking one each turn) and on their final turn all that was left was a red tile and they just stuck it on top without thinking. Then, allowing them to drop it to the floor prior to wall-tiling would be equivalent to them legally dropping it to the floor straight from the draw pile. So why give them the higher penalty just for temporarily sticking it on the top row?

Except that there is explicit mention in the variant rules that this situation can happen. It just doesn't say when you get to drop stuff to the floor as a result--before starting wall-tiling (but after all collecting is over) or during wall-tiling.

It says the problem would occur during wall-tiling, but if you notice it before starting to do the top-to-bottom, why not incur a penalty then, per the rules, and drop the 4-row to the bottom? Seems more in the spirit of the game to me.

I'm saying it doesn't matter which order you determine it in, before or after you start wall tiling. You can't place both rows, so you take the more severe penalty and drop the size 4 row to the floor, and to quote Edward from the Heavy Cardboard Podcast. "Plan Better™"

And that's probably what some groups would do. Others would say "clean things up before you start scoring." It would be like the farm scoring in Carcassonne before the 18th version of the rules came out. People in different groups would all have their house rule. And I hate that in games. What it seems to me is that the publisher didn't do due diligence (read: a development team) when writing that rule and didn't cover the case clearly.

"Illegally"? It's probably incompetent play, but I don't see what's illegal about it.

You can't legally move both those rows to the right during the wall-tiling phase, but the variant rules explicitly note (in the "Special Case") that this situation can arise, and tell you that in case you can't move some row to the right, you must send those tiles to the floor.

Quote:

I have the first printing (Plan B) of the game, there's no "Special Case" in my rule book. So that's why I seemed to ignore it -- it's not in my rulebook. Thanks for pointing it out though, I need to get an update copy of it printed. I'm going to guess Randy has a Plan B copy as well.

EDIT: Found a copy online at Next Move's website:

Next Move Rulebook States in the Variant section:
Special case: In the wall-tiling phase, it may happen that you are not able to move the rightmost tile of a certain pattern line over to the wall because there is no valid space left for it.

Sorry, as it's been mentioned above, I have the first print off the game and in those rules there is no mention to the special case. But even reading it, of you follow the order of placentero, you are allowed to place the first tile, but then, when you go to the 4th, you can't place it and, therefore, your four tiles go to the floor (i.e. the penalties row).

I believe that we are actually both song the same thing!

But my issue is that it says "it may happen that you are not able to move the rightmost tile of a certain pattern line". Well, looking at that picture, before any wall-tiling commences, I can sure see it and say, "It so happens that I am not able to move the rightmost tile of both of those lines and the pattern line I choose to drop to the floor is the 4th. Now let me commence scoring from top to bottom."

I don't see a problem here once I found the rule in the newer edition of the game.

In this case, you must immediately place all tiles of that pattern line in your floor line (see Floor line).

So you start the wall-tiling phase (as is stated right there at the beginning). You move the single tile into the top row, because it's legal to do so at this point. Then you get down to the 4th row and "it happens that you are not able to move the rightmost tile over to the wall because there is no valid space left for it." And it says "In this case, you must immediately place all tiles of that pattern line in your floor line."

I'm terribly late to this party, but something doesn't sound right here.

I thought that the rules allowed you to drop (to the floor line) any tiles that you don't want to place (on your wall). If that's true, why wouldn't you just drop the single red tile to the floor line, and add the red tile from the 4-row to your wall? It would significantly reduce the penalty points you would suffer.

Yes, you have to deal with each pattern line from top to bottom, but can't you simply choose to drop any tiles you don't want to place?

Yes, you get into the original poster's situation by making a mistake. But it's certainly not illegal or anything. When I first started trying the variant side of the board, it took me a few tries before I realized that you wanted to follow the diagonal lines for each type of tile. I didn't notice that I was following the diagonals when I was using the original board simply because I didn't need to realize it. I was just following the patterns laid out on the original board...

It sounds like you're remembering the rule about tiles you don't want to place when you take them from the factory, in Phase A (Factory Offer), and invalidly trying to apply it in Phase B (Wall Tiling).

In Phase B (Wall-Tiling), there is no such rule about choosing to move tiles to the floor.

That's definitely the quickest way to bring the game to a very quick end but your score will me minimal with a max score of 17.

I'd agree with the others, re-read the manual. Watch a play through video. There's a lot more to the game.

Respuesta 5:
In other words, in each round you will be placing multiple tiles across all rows. When all tiles have been placed, everyone will then move one tile from each complete row to the right (and discard all othe tiles from that row). As players do this, they score the appropriate points from their placements.

Respuesta 6:
You are playing incorrectly.

Respuesta 7:
What was your winning score? There’s a big difference between ending the game and winning the game. Completing a row triggers the end of the game, but at the expense of completing columns and 5 of a kind...not to mention all the in game scoring.

Just to be clear, you draft tiles until there are none left. Then you move a tile from each completed row over to the grid and score it, going from the top down. Then you refresh the tiles and repeat until someone completes a row in the end of round scoring and ends the game. Then do the end game bonuses.

Respuesta 8:
What are you doing with all the other tiles you are picking up? Each turn you MUST pick up tiles. If you are only filling the top row, then after the first turn, you will have to put all the other tiles on the floor if you are not putting them in the triangular grid. That will put you well and truly in last place as they all score negative points.

As others have said, you must pick up tiles each turn. You only score each round - when all the tiles in the centre are gone. And you only move your tiles from the triangular grid to the square scoring grid in the scoring phase.

If you are just gunning for your top row, you will be leaving prime tiles for your opponents. Although you rush the end game, better tile placement will win every time. A complete row is only a two point bonus.

Have only played this game once. I won because I continually just filled the top row which only contains one space. I must be missing something because this made the game too easy. Put a tile in top row. Row is full. Move it to the right. Repeat until you win. What am I missing?
You don't move the tile to the right just because the row is full. You move tiles to the right after the round ends (i.e. all tiles have been taken from the table).
I'm questioning also the likelihood of always being able to collect single tiles (and no mention is made of the negative points).

True. I would add that the skill level of the opposing player makes a difference as well. The game is deceptively tactical, with the better option often coming down to creating situations that force opponents to take unwanted tiles for negative points.

Respuesta 14:
As others have said, this seems to be down to a mistake over interpretation of the rules. I think it's the difference between turns and rounds that you need to check again.

Each round consists of three parts:
1. Factory Offer
2. Wall Tiling
3. Clean up

During Part 1, you will have multiple turns where you move tiles from the factories to the bottom left of your player board. It's only once all of the factories (including the centre) are empty that you move onto Part 2, and start moving tiles across to the bottom right. When you do move them across, you can only move them to the same row as is directly across to the right from them.

I hope that makes sense, and that you get a lot of enjoyment out of the game.



Tema 391: Can you take penalty point on purpose ?
Pregunta:
I would like to know if you can take a penalty point on purpose even if you can fir it in a roll. That way it doesn't jam up that specific color in that roll.
Thanks.

Respuesta 1:
Yes. It's stated in the rules.

Respuesta 2:
You are allowed to do that, as per the rules

Any tiles you have picked that you cannot or do not want to place according to the rules, you must place in your floor line

Thanks for the response. I found it in the rules now

Respuesta 5:
An additional question please: if on the last row for example, I have 3 blue tiles and 2 empty spots and in the middle there are 2 blue tiles.
Can I pick the two blue tiles from the middle, put one on the last row (now I have 4 blue tiles and one empty spot) and put the other one on my floor line? (so I can delay scoring the row)
Thanks!

I don't see how the rules would allow you to choose not fill your chosen line in that case:

M Stock
@rules
Then, add the tiles you picked to one of the 5 pattern lines on your player board.
...
• Once all spaces of a pattern line are filled, that line is considered complete. If you have picked up more tiles than you can place in your chosen pattern line, you must place the excess tiles in the floor line (see Floor line).

But also, as above:

suggests that you could choose to place one in the pattern line according to the rules and then choose to place the other in your floor line.

I can't really fathom why you'd want to though. Any marginal scoring benefit from order of tile placement would surely be outweighed by the line being clogged up for another turn.

Respuesta 8:
When I am scoring, let's assume the the first column is like this (X means being full and - means being empty)

X
X
X
-

If on row 4 I have 3 tiles for example, and no way to get another tile this round as they ran out and on row 5 I have 3 tiles and the possibility of taking 2 more, I might chose to wait scoring row 5 for next round (put 1 tile on row 5 and 1 tile on floor line).

Because if I score it now, I will get 1 point. If I wait for next round, I have a big chance of finishing row 4 and 5 as I am waiting on 1 tile for each row, and I will score 5 points for row 5 (as I will score 4 points for the previous row first and then 5 points for row 5). Does it make sense?

Respuesta 9:
Yeah, that's the marginal benefit I was talking about - in this case, you get 1 + 5 = 6 points by finishing now or 4 + 5 = 9 points for finishing next time. But I think in most cases, that 3 points isn't enough to compensate the lost opportunity to fill that row again, and the possible disaster of getting caught with a bunch of tiles that can only go on the floor.

Respuesta 10:
Yes, you are right, most of the times it's not worth the wait.

I was just wondering if it's legal by the rules, as it seems that it is legit.

Thank you for your insight!

True; I think I was (unconsciously) interpreting it to mean that you pick a row, and then fill that row as much as possible, but that you're free to pick a row into which you can't place the tiles. I.e. you don't have to pick a row which lets you place the tiles.

But indeed it also plausibly could mean that you can place as many or as few tiles as you want on a selected row which can take the tiles. Hmm. Must ponder further...

Interesting that   explicitly removes this choice:
Quote:
"However, as long as you have a strip with [space], you must place the pieces on that strip - even if you would prefer to drop them all on the floor"
I recently picked up   after enjoying my first two plays of it. Unfortunately, after a few more plays I found that my opponents' choices had too little impact on how the game played out so it started to feel repetitive and dull after only a few plays. I so much prefer Azul where a good chunk of the game is playing hot potato with that group of 7 blue tiles in the middle. It feels just the right level of "mean" where you're almost always doing things to help yourself, but if you help yourself in the right order you also hurt your opponent(s).

There have been quite a few times where I'll end a round with a 4- or 5-tile row still empty and I'll drop the one remaining tile onto the floor rather than start a large row in a color I don't want to work on.

I wonder if having compulsory placement would make the game feel frustrating. It's one thing to end a round with a big chunk of negative points, but it could sour the feel of the game to start a round knowing it's not going to go well for you.

You were definitely correct the first time. You are NOT allowed to split up tiles voluntarily. The Rule Book shows an example for placing tiles and all possible options.

I can sort of see the angleshoot due to the ambiguous gap between the "one by one" wording and the "once all spaces of a pattern line are filled" because it doesn't explicitly mention that you must keep going one by one until the line is filled, but that is the intent of the rules.

Without the example shown in the Rule Book, I think you'd have a case for this loophole.

I had this situation come up and I thought the rules were ambiguous. The rule says any tiles you cannot or do no wish to place can b placed on the floor.

I did not realize that meant you must finish completing a row you start to complete before putting pieces on the floor. On which page specifically is this made clear?


I cannot recall why I wanted to do it, but I did, for some reason.




Unrelated question. If someone draws four of a kind from the first factory, I assume he places the "1" tile in the middle by itself. Can the next player just pull the "zero" colored tiles from the middle, as well as the "1," and put the 1 on his floor without playing any tiles anywhere on his rows or the floor? Or must it wait until at least one colored tile is in the middle to take the "1"?

You can't take the 1 on its own.

I think pretty clearly you're not allowed to take zero tiles. Otherwise the game would often get into a cycle of everyone taking zero tiles at the end of a round when there are only tiles left which no one can place without penalty.

I agree with you both; I think the "1" stays there until a partial factory gets pushed into the center. Keep in mind though that I put "zero" in quotes because the person taking the 1" would technically be taking a tile (and a penalty).


This is clearly different than an end game situation where there are five colors left and 8 gold, and no one can use them, so the person due to get stuck with the golds says "I take zero tiles."

Well, you're making me question myself now and it seems a lot of people are agreeing your interpretation.

To me, the bottom of Page 4 is where it's made... kind of clear. This doesn't include the picture of course but you can infer the situation:

Quote:
Andrea picks 2 yellow tiles from a Factory display.

She is not allowed to place them in her second or third pattern line, as
their corresponding wall lines each have a yellow tile.

She may not place them in the fourth pattern line either, as there is
already 1 blue tile and she may not add tiles of a different color to it.

She may, however, place 1 of them in the first pattern line and the excess tile in the floor line (A).

Or she may place both tiles in the fifth pattern line (B).

She may even choose to place both tiles in the floor line (C)
I take this to mean A), B), and C) is a comprehensive list of options for Andrea's turn.

True, but I think it also says elsewhere, "any tiles you can or do not wish to place legally may be placed on the floor." Or something like that.

Alright, I just ran into this scenario and we didn't know what to do.

At the end of a round, a friend is forced to take 2 red tiles. If he places them in the 2nd row, he will complete a row of tiles and end the game...

However, he's behind and does not want to end the game yet, so he places one red tile in the 2nd row and places the other red tile on the floor line. This way, he gets a head start on the 2nd row without ending the game before he's ready.

Given the "do not wish" qualifier in the rules, we're letting it play this time, but I would prefer it be against the rules. So that's another case where this is an optimal play.

Why do you need any other official clarification than the official rules?

The rules explicitly allow this move. This is a smart move of your friend, and even if you do not like it it is legal.
Of course you can introduce your own house rule to restrict that... but why?

If you want tho end the game earlier, than it's up to you to force this



Tema 392: Looking for a variant without scoring
Pregunta:
Hi, I've played this game few times, and like the mechanism, but dislike the principe of scoring. Always making score, it's so boring. So I'm looking for variant rules, if someone has already thought about it, to play this game without the sentence of scoring.

I don't know, perhaps some challenges, the first one who make 2 vertical lines for example...
Or else...

Has someone thought about these kind of rules?

Respuesta 1:
1. Play the game

2. Don't score

It's easy!

Respuesta 2:
How many games don't have scoring after every round?

As far as games, I for one like seeing how far (or gulp behind) my opponent.

Respuesta 3:
One optional variant would be to have all of the tiles the same color. Then put only one tile on each factory space. This will eliminate the need for keeping score as all players will be equal.

Respuesta 4:
Presumably, the OP wouldn't mind if there was a little bit of scoring? I'm thinking something very simple at the end of the game only, and which doesn't require a score tracker. How about....

Score = Tiles Installed - (minus) Tiles Smashed

The only rule changes would be:
Smashed tiles are kept by players for the whole game, instead of returned to supply.
1st player tile isn't counted as a smashed tile.
Game ends when tile supply runs out.

The scoring materials provided in this game are a sorry blemish on an otherwise magnificently produced game.

Race games. It shouldn't be too difficult to come up with a race version of Azul. e.g. a race to produce a certain pattern or number of tiles.

One important issue to address though, is how to accommodate smashed tiles in a race variant. Smashed tiles are a key feature of Azul and players should be rightly penalised for them.

A pad of paper and a pencil will do the scoring just fine, with no chance of moving the cubes by accident. Nice and portable, too.

Keep the line, column, color bonus.
Idea for the line bonus : 2 VP if you fill the top line (the easiest), 4 VP for the 2nd line, 6 ..., 8 ..., 10 VP for the bottom line (hardest)

Add personal (hidden or public) or common objectives : a 3x3 square, the 4 corners, two non-adjacent columns, a majority/minority in such color (among other tiles or players), the up diagonal...



Tema 393: English / Dutch review Azul
Pregunta:
English / Dutch

Hi readers, hi lezers

Azul is currently the no. 1 game in the category Family and therefor a well selling game. At some places it is even hard to get, especially it's expansion (the Joker Tiles).
I could get my hands on Azul and here is what I think.

Op dit moment staat Azul gerankt op nr. 1 in de categorie Familie en aldus een goed verkopend spel. Op sommige plekken is het zelfs moeilijk te verkrijgen, vooral de uitbreiding (the Joker Tiles).
Ik kon het spel wél op de kop tikken en hier is wat ik ervan vind.

Theme / Thema (strong)
The game is about decorating a wall. For that you have the collect tiles from the factory and prepare the decorating. Watch out, because if the preperation is not done effectivly enough, tiles will fall on the floor causing damage.

Het spel draait om het decoreren van een muur. Daar dien je tegels voor te verzamelen vanuit de fabriek en de decoratie voor te bereiden. Maar pas op, want als de voorbereiding niet effectief genoeg verloopt, zullen er tegels op de grond vallen en dit zal schade met zich meebrengen.

Price / Prijs (OK)
The original price for Azul comes around $44,- / €40,- / £35,-, which is a fair price for a boardgame. Especially one that you will enjoy for a lot of games. With the selling going as good as Azul, the prices on the internet can go up considerably high.

De oorspronkelijke prijs voor Azul ligt rond de $44,- / €40,- / £35,-, wat een redelijke prijs is voor een bordspel. Zeker voor eentje die je vele malen zal spelen. Met de goede verkoop zoals bij Azul, kunnen de prijzen op internet aanzienlijk stijgen.


Quality / Kwaliteit (superb)
Azul comes with 100 tiles, 5 different prints, 20 pieces a print, and an additional 1st-player tile. These tiles are thic plastic, not made of cardboard. The 4 player boards are full color and two-side printed, as the backside can be used for a game variant. The factories are printed on 9 circle shaped cardboard pieces, again two-side printed. The score marker is a little wooden square, painted black. The game provides a cloth bag for the 100 tiles. Quality of the materials is great.

Azul komt met 100 tegels, 5 verschillende prints, 20 stuks per print, en een extra 1e-speler tegel. Deze tegels zijn van dik plastic, niet van karton. The 4 spelerkaarten zijn in kleur en dubbelzijdig geprint, omdat de achterkant voor een spelvariant gebruikt kan worden. Ook de fabrieken zijn dubbelzijdig op karton geprint, in cirkels. De scoremarker is een klein zwart geverfd blokje. Het spel wordt geleverd met een stoffen zak voor de 100 tegels. De kwaliteit van de materialen is erg goed.

Artwork / Aankleding (Good, quite detail)
Azul is so colorful, that when I bought the game in the gamestore, my girl wanted to carry the box through the city because she loved all the colors. It is really an eyecatcher (both the box AND my girl ).
Not only the colors are that good, the layout of the player boards are very clear, it is hard not to understand these boards.
A flaw is that the colors of the tiles that supposed to be the same, or not always. Differences in color tints are annoying, even though this is a minor detail.

Azul is zo kleurrijk, toen ik het spel kocht in de spellenwinkel, wilde mijn vriendin de doos door de stad dragen, omdat ze de kleuren zo mooi vond. Het is een echte blikvanger.
Niet alleen de kleuren zijn zo in het oog springend, ook de vormgeving van de spelerkaarten zijn zeer duidelijk, het is moeilijk om deze kaarten niet te begrijpen.
Een minpunt is dat niet alle kleuren van de tegels die wel hetzelfde zouden moeten zijn, dat niet altijd zijn. Verschillen in kleurtinten zijn irritant, zelfs al gaat het hier om een pietluttig detail.

Learning / Aanleren (very easy)
Yes, it is very easy. Only one read and your are as good as set to go. First time when you play it, you might consult the manual 1, maybe 2 times and that's it.

Ja, het is bijzonder makkelijk. Eén keer doorlezen en je bent klaar om te spelen. De eerste keer dat je speelt, zal je de handleiding 1, misschien 2 keer moeten raadplegen en da's alles.

Weight / Moeilijkheidsgraad (light-medium)
To decorate your wall as effectivly as possible, that means that you have to prepare the decoration in a way you score the most possible points and without too many tiles fallling on the ground, takes little brain activity. But not much though. Even when you had a fallacy, or when your strategy didn't work out as planned, there is no major fallback or a situation you cannot recover from.

Om je muur zo effectief mogelijk te decoreren, dus om de voorbereiding zo te treffen dat je de meest mogelijke punten scoort zonder dat er teveel tegels op de grond vallen, vraagt dat lichte breinactiviteit. Niet meer dan dat. En zelfs als je een denkfout maakt, of je strategie pakt niet zo uit als gewenst, is er geen grote terugval of een situatie waar je niet meer uit kan komen.

Luck / Geluk (low)
What tiles are in the factories and what your opponent(s) take from the factory is as good as all the (un)luck there is in Azul. Even when another player make a move that is unfortunate for you, you can easily reconsider strategy / planning.

Welke tegels er in de fabrieken komen en welke daarvan door je tegenstanders worden toegeëigend is eigenlijk alle (on)geluk in dit spel. Zelfs wanneer een ander speler een voor jou onfortuinlijke zet doet, kan je gemakkelijk je strategie / planning omgooien.

Interaction / Interactie (only a bit)
The interaction is quite low, that is because you're planning your own decoration. Ofcourse you are sometimes 'fighting' for the same tiles, or you choose certain tiles, so that your opponent has no other choise than to destroy some tiles by letting them fall on the ground.

De interactie is behoorlijk laag, omdat je vooral met je eigen planning van de decoratie bezig bent. Natuurlijk ben je soms met tegenspelers aan het 'vechten' om dezelfde tegels of kies je ervoor om bepaalde tegels te nemen, zodat je tegenstander dan geen andere keuze heeft dan zijn tegels op de grond te laten vallen.

Wainting / Wachten (short)
As with any other game the waiting time depend on the player amount. Azul can take up to 4 players and the waiting time in the first 2-3 round is about 1-2 minutes. When the playerboars fill up a bit, the players need a bit more time to choose the right tiles, the waiting time then goes up to 3-4 minutes max.
When playing a game with 2 player (BGG-ratings states it's the best), the waiting time is at a minimum.

Net als alle andere spellen, de wachttijd is afhankelijk van het aantal spelers. Azul kan tot 4 spelers en de wachttijd in de eerste 2-3 rondes is ergens rond 1-2 minuten. Wanneer de spelerkaarten vol beginnen te raken, hebben spelers iets meer tijd nodig om de juiste tegels te kiezen, de wachttijd gaat dat richting de 3-4 minuten maximaal.
Wanneer je een spel met 2 personen speelt (BGG-beoordelingen wijzen dit als beste optie uit), is de wachttijd echt minimaal.

Lenght / Speelduur (0.5 - 1 hour)
The game itself states 1 game takes about 40-50 minutes. When playing this the first 2-3 times and with at least 3 players, you might take a little longer. When you played this over 3-4 times, you will have a hard time go over 45 minutes, even with 4 players.

Het spel zelf claimt dat 1 spel ongeveer 40-50 minuten duurt. Wanneer je het voor de eerste 2-3 keer speelt en met minimaal 3 spelers, kan je er nog wel wat langer over doen. Maar als je het meer dan 3-4 keer gespeeld heb, is het moeilijk om er langer dan 45 minuten over te doen, zelfs met 4 spelers.

Replayablity / Herspeelbaarheid (high)
Azul works addictive. Personally I am always kinda put off by game that always start the same (Photosyntheses is a great example). Because of the always changing tiles in de factories, your planning is always different - even when you use the same strategy. That makes you want to play again when the game is over, also if you've lost: because it was the stupid tiles, not my strategy!

Azul werkt verslavend. Persoonlijk vind ik het altijd een afknapper als spellen altijd hetzelfde beginnen (Photosyntheses is een goed voorbeeld). Omdat de tegels in de fabrieken altijd anders zijn, is je planning dat ook - óók als je dezelfde strategie gebruikt. Dat maakt dat je het spel nog eens wilt spelen als het voorbij is, ook als je hebt verloren: dat komt door die stomme tegels, niet mijn strategie!

Overall / Conclusie (8/10)
Azul is fun, quite easy to play and replayable. You can easily play 3, 4 maybe even 5 rounds in a row without getting bored with the game. It's a great family game, although I doubt that 8-12 year olds find this game amusing. As said earlier, the game is very good for a 2 person match! If you can get Azul for the 'normal' price, you are in for an enjoyable time

Azul is leuk, vrij makkelijk om te spelen en herspeelbaar. Je speelt met gemak 3, 4 misschien zelfs 5 rondes achter elkaar zonder er op uitgekeken te raken. Een prima familiespel, hoewel ik me afvraag in hoeverre een 8-12 jarige dit een leuk spel vindt. Zoals eerder gezegd, het spel is zeer geschikt voor een spel met 2 spelers! Als je Azul voor de 'normale' prijs kan krijgen, ga je een leuke tijd tegemoet



Tema 394: what do you do when you can't pick any tile with regular moves?
Pregunta:
Good day to you all,
as the title says i have this question about the rules of the game:

when you don't have any regular moves to do (because all your lines are full or the tiles avaible don't match the colors you have in lines for examples) you have to take tiles and dump them in your dead zone (scoring negatives points) or you 'simply' pass turn?

Reading the rules some friends told me that the right case would be the first (scoring negative) but i was playing with the second variant and find it more balanced so i ask you what you think about it.

Personally forcing a player to pass a turn is a pretty nice negative effect for me(he/she loses 1 action and his/her opponent gains 1 more pick leaving a point gap that depends on the other players ability to foresee and on the overall situation of the board) that can be recovered and don't penalize too much noob, or unlucky, players. Instead i've the impression that with the obligation to take 'impossibile to use' tiles and score negative points the gap created is too wide, difficult to recover and heavly linked to the behaviour of the previous player (in fact if he/she is mean in the second part of the game he/she can litterally opt to kill the next player instead to scoring for himself) making the game really sensible to player placement on the table and widening the gap beetween pro players and normal players (because hardly the expert ones will take many negative tiles but instead they will leave them to noobs one leaving them farthest possibile in the score board).

What do you think about it?

Respuesta 1:
You can't pass a turn. You must always take something, and any part of it you can't fit goes on to the floor for negative points.

Respuesta 2:
You are forced to choose.

You should eventually learn to count forward 1-2 round, and try to prepare yourself for any negative effects.

Respuesta 3:
A little explanation.
As the owner of the game, and a good player, to foresee next moves is not a problem for me.. but it is for not skilled player with which i play.

The point here is not me blaming the rules for not lettin' me win (because the behaviour pattern of the pro player of azul change very little with or without this rule), but the contrary: the rules this way are to penalizing for normal player widening to much the gap between skilled players and others (and between skilled players next to each other favoring the first in clockwise order). Thinking that this game is a perfect fit for casual gamers, this is a sort of huge backdrop for me and this was the motive for my question.

Cleared that original rules imply the oblige to take impossibile to place tiles and negative scoring, it would not be best to use my variant to play?

The concept of "balanced" is not about protecting the unskilled players from the expert ones.

If you like your variant, there is nothing wrong using your own house rules. But, you will also need to add another rule to cover for when all players decide to pass.

Our friend's eight year old daughter is vicious in this game. The adults are all seasoned gamers, but she'll hate draft the heck out of you and force you into negative points in a heartbeat.

Here i am, again
Sorry but i went on vacation and couldn't continue to argue about this, however i think you have misinterpreted something.

My variant doesn't imply that a player may pass whenever he/she wants, it says only that a player HAVE TO pass only when he could not take a tile inserting it legally in his/her mosaics.

It's a thing that happens not so often, and that impact for the 90% of the time naive player who have not foreshadowed the last moves of a round and is very difficult that could happen to a pro-player ( a pro player isn't simply "a self-appointed expert azul player" but a player who is good at boardgames, because he/she plays often or because of proper play skills).

I think Azul is a perfect family boardgame that can introduce people to more complex games and this explain why i speak of balancing as to not be too hard on newbies (balancing in games, as you were saying, have a more complex background that just this).
If i have a friend or a parent that don't play games, if not classic family games like risiko or monopoly, and I want them to play a serious boardgame (not luck based) i will choose a game in which they can have fun and compete fairly even if they don't win because of luck of skill due to their inexperience, making them desire for more plays. And Azul it would be a perfect game for this.. but in my experience losing going under 10 points for a single bad move because of bad forecast is a 100% ragequitting of the game (before you misenterpreted again: I do not behave like this, but i see it happens around me all the time). This is why i think my variant is best if you are playing with unskilled players leaving the game more balanced for them.

Said this, i did other matches with the normal rules, but i really couldn't find neat differences with the game because players had gained experience and did not leave many illegal pieces to take forcibly (so things didn't change much). These matches however confirmed, for now, that the game is really dependent on the order of players on the table and that the impact of my variant not affect much players accustomed of the game basics.

And this is all, at least for now, thank you all for your answers!

I don't agree with this at all. Skilled players can definitely plan ways to stick someone with a color he cannot place anywhere. The person who picks from the second-to-last factory gives the power to the next player to decide who goes last and how many different colors there will be. Once it gets to the later rounds, it may not be possible to leave a spot for all available colors.

Tema 395: Opinion on travel version
Pregunta:
I am making a travel version with small counting cubes. I have thousands in different colors and want to put them to use (math teacher ).

These are not finalized as I have some cleaning and editing to finish.

Tema 396: Is it common that you end up with a bunch of tiles nobody can use?
Pregunta:
Hi,

played my first game an Azul today with 2 players and we encountered a situation with 6 blue tiles in the middle and neither of us could place more than 2. The player who had to take this as her last move was not happy (my wife). We probably made one or many rookie mistakes, but once the blue tiles where in the middle, either of us had to take the negative points and it was a matter of counting who would be affected.

So the question - is this a common situation (hopefully not) and how do you mitigate that? I am asking because my wife (who was affected) might be inclined not to play again because we find counting 6-8 moves ahead not fun.

Respuesta 1:
Yes, it's common, particularly with 2. You mitigate it by taking tiles before they build up in the middle or by keeping your 4 and 5 rows open so that you can pick up a big load later.

Basically this. I've seen this almost happening with me and my girlfriend too and usually I try to avoid that to happen picking them before they gather all in the middle. Specially because I can be the one person to take them all, distracted as I am

Respuesta 3:
It's dog eat dog in the tiling business.
Part of the strategy of Azul, especially in 2p, is to force your opponent to pick up tiles they don't want. It can backfire badly though.

If you don't want to play mean (we don't) the best idea is to keep an eye on the centre and pick up from there before the situation gets real bad, even if it means taking a small hit.

Respuesta 4:
Trying to dump unuseable tiles on your opponent while avoidinf having that happen to you is part of tbe strategy. It’s extremely common.

Respuesta 5:
I think, since this has been winning awards and is extremely popular, that people assume it isn't mean. As a 2-player game, this is a really cutthroat game. I love that about it but I think people have an impression that it's a multi-player solitaire game.

We played a few more times and by keeping an eye on the center managed to avoid it getting too bad. And we had a good time playing the game.

Thanks for all the feedback!

BTW it is not so much the cut throat nature that bugged me but the fact that it is not fun for me counting to find out who will be hurt by the pile of unusable tiles.

Respuesta 8:
It's actually the whole point of the game to try to avoid it for yourself and try to make it happen to your opponent(s)...

Respuesta 9:
Manipulating the tiles in the middle is a big part of the game at any player count. Making sure your opponent eats the negative points instead of you is a big part of the 2p game.

Respuesta 10:
I find that I actually watch the centre area very closely, and our group tends to willingly pick up that initial -1 penalty tile from the centre when an opportunity presents itself to grab 4 or five of the same tile and fill one of the two bottom rows. We rarely end up with a bigger quantity, but yes, it sometimes does happen. Hopefully to someone else.

The jury only receives revenue through licensing fees, which the association charges for use of their own logo – the playing pawn – for publicity purposes. If an award-winning publisher wants to advertise using the title “Spiel des Jahres”, they can do this for free. But if they want to print the “Spiel des Jahres” logo on the box, they need to pay a very small licensing fee per game sold. The amount charged depends on whether this is for the main awards, nominated games or the special awards.

The licensing agreement with winners of the main awards is unrestricted, the licence-holder may cancel the agreement at any time and refrain from using the label in future.

Of course, producers may refer to the award in their publicity after this period but they may no longer print the symbol on the box.

See above - basically we opted to only use the logo in Germany.
While completely humbled by the award, I don’t think it would have substantially increased sales in other markets. Considering the royalty would be on all titles sold with the logo, it certainly adds up.

Did the German copy come with English rules? It’s German on the back of box? Not worth it just for pawn to me, but interesting.

Feels like a chicken/egg problem on awards. The US audience can be trained to look for the pawn, but not if the publishers don’t include it on US editions! I have seen copies of games at Target with the pawn, and my copy of Ticket To Ride and Just one and others have it.

Did the German copy come with English rules? It’s German on the back of box? Not worth it just for pawn to me, but interesting.

Feels like a chicken/egg problem on awards. The US audience can be trained to look for the pawn, but not if the publishers don’t include it on US editions! I have seen copies of games at Target with the pawn, and my copy of Ticket To Ride and Just one and others have it.

Sorta - the gaming consumer (who shops at flgs, OLGS) is very well educated. They don’t need to be trained. The average joe who sees it at Target, B&N won’t know any difference. Logos help because it lends some credibility but will that SdJ logo carry any more weight - imo, not in mass market.

As for Azul German edition, it’s not multilingual edition. So all in German. As someone who works for the publisher, I wanted it for my collection for similar reasons - I like having those logos. Azul is simple enough that I don’t know if a manual is super relevant for my gaming group, but YMMV.

Yes, it can be a little messy. Not an ideal experience.

Respuesta 2:
Yes. Add one set of 25 tiles, 1 player board, and 2 factories per additional player. Five-player works very nicely. Six is still enjoyable. I do not recommend seven or more.

Respuesta 3:
we play 5 by adding 25 tiles, but only 1 extra factory disk, makes for a tighter game.



Tema 400: Azul: sibling to Zooloretto: The Dice Game?
Pregunta:
I know, you clicked on this with your eyebrows raised.
I can see your skeptical face from here.
Or perhaps not, perhaps you have played both and you clicked to dispute and/or agree with me.
Perhaps.

First, I know they are not the same game. My argument is that Azul is the older sibling. It's seen a little more of life, is a little more complex and knows what it wants.

Are you familiar with the rules?
Here is the shortest possible summary of both.

This is Azul's playing board

You gather tiles from a central source and make a prescribed pattern based on picking matching tiles and placing them on one of the rows.
If you pick too many for that row they are moved to the bottom and count as negative points at the end. You receive points for placing tiles in the pattern. The game is obviously more nuanced than this, and please don't play the game based on this general description, but...

This is Zooloretto: The Dice Game's playing score pad.

You role dice and then place them on a central source. At your discretion you pick up the dice and make a prescribed pattern based on picking matching animals and placing them on one of the rows. If you pick too many for that row they are moved to the bottom and count as negative points at the end. You receive points for placing animals in the row. This game is obviously a little more nuanced than this, and please don't play the game based on this general description, but...

Do you see it?!

Still skeptical?

Truth be told, the more I play games the more I see the similarities between them. I have purchased a game more than once only to get it home and realize I kind of own it already -- or close enough.

Respuesta 6:
ziggy678 - You are not alone in seeing Zooloretto as an ancestor for Azul, and I highlighted the same general mechanisms (drafting; filling a 'paddock' and scoring it in some way; the 'barn' for leftovers and penalties) with my game group a few months ago such that I wouldn't be surprised that Zooloretto was a starting point for the game design.

I prefer Zooloretto (SDJ version, not the dice game) though as I feel it brings more of a 'fun energy' to the table, has simple variants/expansions (e.g. the petting zoo, disregarding Aquaretto which I felt was too 'gamey' and lost the fun, simplicity and charm of the original), and has a better theme (for me), thus I have opted not to purchase Azul as I already own and enjoy the broadly similar mechanisms as presented in Zooloretto.

Respuesta 7:
Good to know! I've had Zooloretto on my wish list for some time, but the OOP price tag has kept me away. I love to thrift board games though, so I still hope to find it one day!

The Azul situation in the UK isn't good, and hasn't been for months.

There are copies on Amazon for about £70. It may be worth contacting the sellers to ask if they are including all the expansion tiles or are simply offering two copies of this £35.00 game.

Alternatively, find a European online games shop --- Germany and France seem to have cheaper postage to the UK than Scandinavia and further flung parts of Western Europe --- and you should be able to find a copy for about €35.00 for the game and €10.00–15.00, about €50.00 (£45.00-ish) including delivery.

I'd much rather give my money to a proper game shop than to some greedy git trying to cash-in on Amazon.



Tema 402: [FINISHED] Cloth player boards!
Pregunta:
I have been playing Azul a bit, and it would be an amazing game for on holidays, IF everything could fit in the main bag.

The problem: the player boards are made of card board.

This is what made me think of maybe getting the board printed on cloth, so I can fold them up and store them in the bag. Anyone who has tried this? Or tips on where I can do it?

It would also be amazing if someone had the player boards in high-res (maybe vector, if available) for highest possible quality.

I can of course also just print the board on paper, but that won't last forever, while cloth will at least hold a lot longer.

I have bought a package with 10 sheets of paper, so I might as well use them

If I make a common score tracker, I'll have to add extra components to keep track of the score, so that's maybe not wanted?

I'm almost done with the player board WITH scoring track, which I will upload in a bit.

Edit: However, the factory tiles can easily be fitted in the main bag, so I don't really see a reason to make them on cloth.

Respuesta 7:
NOTE: THE IMAGE BELOW IS NOT MIRRORED, SO IF YOU PRINT THIS AND TRANSFER THIS ON CLOTH, IT WILL BE MIRRORED!

Here we go! The white area is the size of A4, so it should be no problem printing this on a normal printer.



I don't really see the use of doing the same with the factory-tiles, it won't really make the game easier to set up, which would be the main reason to do it.

Ready to play!

All in all it worked pretty good and I'm looking forward to trying it out. The colors got a bit too vibrant, so next time (and as a tip to anyone attempting the same), I am going to lighten the print with about 10%.

Also, I found out it's better to roll them, than to fold them, since it's not really cloth, but a small plastic layer melted on top.

I only ruined one player board, because I read online you could iron a normal sheet of paper on top of it, to make a protective layer. However, that didn't work with my transfer paper, so it melted the blank sheet of paper on top of the print, simply destroying it. So at the moment, I'm stuck at 3 player boards, haha! I'm going to reprint one today, and finish the project tonight.

Tema 403: Penalty for mis-play?
Pregunta:
From rules: You are not allowed to place tiles of a certain color in
a pattern line whose corresponding line of your wall already
holds a tile of that color.

The rules do not cover this scenario:

During the middle of a round, a player realizes that earlier they have played three yellow tiles to their '4' storage row, but on an earlier turn that player had already scored the yellow tile on their '4' row.

Normally, we play a friendly game and point out to a player that they can't make the yellow placement to their '4' row and get themselves into this situation. But now we have an illegal situation and can't undo the play because too many player moves have taken place.


So how do you handle this mis-play situation?

1. When we discovered the situation, the player wanted to IMMEDIATELY remove the three tiles to either off-board or the Floor so that their '4' row was available for play. We said 'NO' as we were still in tile selection phase, not scoring phase.

2. At the end of the round, during scoring, the player wanted to leave the tiles in their '4' storage row because the row was incomplete (and so as to NOT take the Floor penalty). We said 'Move to Floor' because you deserve a penalty for mis-playing. If allowed to select the tiles and keep them in storage row, this could become an end-game strategy to keep tiles away from other players.

THe rulebook really needs to cover this mis-play scenario.

That would be correct. If they had picked the tiles up and found they could not play them anywhere, they would go to the floor. In this case, where the tiles had been played in error, they will still go to the floor since they are unable to be placed.

I can see someone abusing this if they realize they screwed up in a round because if they place them on the left row and no one catches it, they can "discover" it on a round where they don't have any negative tiles to avoid scoring a bunch on the high end. I can't see it happening often, but I can see the "Oops! I shouldn't have played those when I had the 1st player marker..."

Exactly my opinion too. This is not a valid move, and generally not a subject of the rulebook to penalize. It is clear that he CAN'T put those on line 4.

I would allow a rollback, if possible, but if it is intentional, stop playing with that guy.

Rollback if possible, but if not they should be moved to the floor so they take a penalty and hopefully they don't do it again. If they are repeatedly forgetting, that's not a rules issue it's a player issue called cheating.

So how do you handle this mis-play situation?
While it is true/understandable that the player cannot put the 3 tiles back into the middle (ie: undo their move), you can change the move to something that actually was legal, which is scenario #1. A player can intentionally take the 3 yellow tiles, and place it immediately on the floor (ie: to deny a player those tiles). At the end of the round, they will take the shown negative points.

By not allowing that and doing #2, you are making the player take a double penalty--the points (which is a deserved penalty through their play)--and the penalty of not being able to use their row during tile selection. Also you are allowing the misplay to persist throughout the round (instead of correcting it with a legal play). This resolution is unnecessarily harsh (unless that was the goal here).

When you play with new players, it's fine to Mulligan a bad move. I don't think anyone was suggesting that a first time player needed to have the hammers on the kneecaps as a punishment.

At the same time, a harsh penalty is the best teacher if it happens more than once. Sometimes, there has to be that shock and awe penalty to fully imprint that you don't want to pull the tiles you can't place.

Respuesta 11:
I feel the best punishment/compromise is to count the errant tiles as "broken" at the end of the round during the wall phase. Place them on the floor line and knock some points off of their score. However, if the play is the most recent action, and it is possible to rewind, do it. Only a table full of new players walking through their first games should be given any leeway whatsoever in the described scenario. If a veteran of the game is found to have played illegally, off with his head. Or at least the same penalty as previously suggested.

This is Azul. Part of the game is watching where others place tiles. If the game was played with simultaneous actions, I can see where this errant/illegal placement could be made by a new player. (oops!) A seasoned player of high moral fiber would not try to illegally place tiles. (argh!) Generally, and especially with new players, aren't all players responsible for monitoring others for legal play? If an illegal play was made, it was the fault of all players at the table.

Why is there no discussion of this in the rules? IMO A rule book should not need to address a scenario that it clearly and precisely prevents from happening in the first place.

@Mr Moon 420
Why is there no discussion of this in the rules? IMO A rule book should not need to address a scenario that it clearly and precisely prevents from happening in the first place.
The rules say you can't do it in the first place. Now, the tiles cannot be played on the board and any tiles that cannot be placed go to the floor. Those are the rules. The rules cannot expect someone to break a rule, so there's not going to be a specific rule in the book to say "If you don't follow the rules, this is what happens". Because you should never be able to do this if you follow the rules.

But beyond that fact, the rules actually do explain how you handle it, you just need to take the human element and analyze what has actually happened.

Joe took 4 yellows. Joe can play 0 of the yellow tiles. All remaining tiles go to the floor.

The rules handle it. You just need to eliminate the need to find an alternate solution to "correct" the situation.

Respuesta 14:
The best way to handle things like this is to use the kinder sanction if the player notices it themselves and the stricter one if another player notices. This encourages honesty

Respuesta 15:
I agree that the tiles should go immediately to the floor. Or, if there was another legal row for placement I'd allow the player to relocate the tiles if they preferred.

Respuesta 16:
I will follow the special case in the variant play.

//Special case: In the wall-tiling phase, it may happen that you are not able to move the rightmost tile of a certain pattern line over to the wall because there is no valid space left for it. In this case, you must immediately place all tiles of that pattern line in your floor line (see Floor line).//

Respuesta 17:
We played that the person had to continue filling their pattern line as usual, but at the end of the round instead of moving a tile to the wall, you would instead just remove the files to the box.

The move to floor sounds like a better option in my opinion. The way we did it could be brutal, especially if it took a couple rounds to complete the pattern line, tying it up for ultimately 0 points.

I have recently bought a copy of Azul, and I have found that one of the blue tiles is missing. There are 20 tiles of all colours, except the darker blue, which number only 19.

I have e-mailed Next Move Games about the issue three times the last few weeks, but they have not given a reply. Does anyone have any advice about how to get an addition tile for my game?
Apologies - I can help though! Email me directly with your name, address, request and I'll arrange to have it shipped. I am just a smidge behind due to convention season, but I have several I was planning on processing over the weekend.

Tema 405: More Than Just a Pretty Face (an iSlaytheDragon review)
Pregunta:
The first thing you’re likely to notice about Azul is its beauty, and that is what the publisher intends. But Azul is more than just a pretty face. Inside this box are hidden depths.

How It Works
Azul is an abstract game for two to four players. Players are trying to collect sets of tiles to fill in empty spots in their mosaics without collecting too much waste. The player with the most points is the winner.


Azul set up for two players.


To begin, each player receives a player board. Factory tiles are placed in the center playing area dependent on the number of players, and four tiles from the bag are placed on each factory. The first player tile is placed in the center of this area.

On a turn, a player must take tiles from one area. An area can be either a factory or the center of the table. A player must take all tiles of a single color from the area. If the area chosen is a factory, all remaining tiles from the factory are pushed into the center. The first time tiles are taken from the center, the choosing player also takes the first player marker and adds it to their floor (worth negative points at the end of the round).

After a player takes tiles, the player must add them to the rows on the bottom left of their player board. Each row may hold only one color of tiles, and that color must not have already been filled in the corresponding row on the player’s mosaic. Players may only add tiles to a single row on each turn. If more tiles are taken than needed, the excess goes to the player’s floor.

The round ends once all tiles are claimed. Then scoring begins. Scoring happens from top to bottom of the player’s rows. If a row is complete, the player moves one tile from that row to the mosaic. The player scores points “Scrabble style” for tiles placed, one point per connected tile horizontally and one point per connected tile vertically to the tile just placed. (If the tile just placed is not adjacent to other tiles, it’s worth 1 point.) Tiles on the player’s floor are worth negative points and are subtracted from the player’s score. Players discard tiles from all scored rows and from the floor; if a row is incomplete, the tiles remain there for the next round. The first-player marker is placed back in the center of the table, and the player who claimed it will begin the next round.

If any player has completed a row, the game ends. Otherwise, a new round is played. At the end of the game, players score points for completed rows, columns, and colors in their mosaic. The player with the most points wins.

Tile Tales
Designing a “gateway” game, the kind of approachable game that shows new players what modern board gaming has to offer, sounds on paper like an easy task. Just make a game with simple rules. DONE. But it’s not that easy, because in order for a game to be a gateway to new players, you have to get it to appeal to someone likely to introduce it to new players. And therein lies the difficulty. Making a rules-light game probably isn’t that big of a deal, but making a rules-light game that appeals equally to your grandmother and your gaming group is a tough nut to crack. But I think Michael Kiesling has cracked it with Azul.


The factory offer in Azul. Any tiles not taken from the factories the first time are pushed into the center, which becomes another tile-taking area.


Azul combines simple options with grueling decisions. What you can do is easy to understand. What you should do is another matter entirely. Each turn involves taking all the tiles on one kind from one area and placing them in a single row on your board. Simple. But it’s not just a matter of taking tiles randomly and placing them in your rows. Good players will plan ahead, looking at what’s available and at what the other players are doing. And this is where Azul is more than just a game with simple rules.

While Azul has personal player boards, the telltale marker of multiplayer solitaire, it has a great deal of player interaction. Every tile you take is a tile you keep from another player. Every tile you leave in the factory areas is a tile you are giving your opponents. Since you can take only one kind of tile per turn and from only one area and place it in only one row, it’s impossible to achieve all your plans at once. So each turn, you weigh your options, and you have to choose: what is the best opportunity for me now?


Tiles on a player’s floor count against their score. What a waste!


But the best opportunity for you now is rarely straightforward. It might be ideal for you to take the red tiles and the blue. The red are available now in the quantity you need, but you might notice your opponent doesn’t need red tiles but desperately needs blue. Are you willing to take the risk that if you nab the blue tiles, the red tiles will be waiting for you the next time it’s your turn?

This is one of my favorite aspects of Azul: it can be a fairly laid-back game of completing your own mosaic at your own pace, or it can be a cutthroat race against your opponents, each of you trying to read the other players and shrewdly get the tiles you need. In this respect, it’s similar to the best evergreen gateways like Ticket to Ride  and Carcassonne –again, games equally at home with your grandmother or your gaming group because they accommodate both breezy and strategic play.


A board after the first round.


Yet even more than other gateway games, Azul has a bit of a bite. Each round, players score points for the tiles they manage to add to their mosaics, but they lose points for any tiles on their “floor,” excess tiles that they were forced to claim. If you want to play aggressively, rather than bolstering your own score, you can tank an opponent’s. Most other games that are classified as friendly to casual or non-gamers are more forgiving: yes, Aunt Fran might have blocked the one route that made your network connections easy in Ticket to Ride, but you can still take the long way around. By contrast, it can be a little demoralizing in Azul to see your floor fill up with the excesses of either poor planning or malevolent opponents. Yet despite this potentiality in Azul, and even seeing it happen to some players, almost all the players I’ve played with have taken it in stride and still come away with a positive view of the game.


And this is that board scored. Your options slowly taper off as the game goes on, as you either have tiles left over in your rows or you’ve filled spaces on your mosaic.


I think another of the best parts of Azul is the gradual ramp up in depth. The rules are simple, so you can begin playing the game immediately. Players may not know what they’re doing, but it’s hard to go too wrong in the first round, just choosing tiles that fit your rows or that are a “bargain” and scoring a few basic points. And then the second round begins, and you immediately see, Oh yeah–we had tons of blue last round, which means there are fewer in the bag–of course there are fewer out this round. And you begin your next ramble of choosing whichever tiles strike your fancy–and then you remember that each color can be represented only once in each row. And you realize the ways you have boxed yourself in a little, and the game becomes a little tighter, a little more constraining. And it gets more and more constraining as the game goes on, as your rows fill up and you have to skillfully maneuver the minefield that is the Azul factories: you don’t want to leave too many opportunities to your opponents, but you also recognize that you can’t take certain tiles without earning penalties yourself. Again, this is something you don’t necessarily see when you first start a game of Azul; it gradually dawns on you as you play. And this is brilliant. The game has a natural arc to it, and it provides quick feedback to allow players to learn.

And there’s also enough depth that you learn from game to game. You become more familiar with the rhythm of the game, and with what scoring potential each tile has. You begin to balance opportunism with long-term planning, and your mosaic gets a little better with each play. At least, ideally. You’ve still got your pesky opponents to worry about.


The final mosaics.


Azul supports play for two to four players, and I like it at all counts. In fact, I don’t think there’s a count I prefer it at. There’s a little more control in a two-player game, and I think two-player is probably the most cutthroat way to play, but I still enjoy it. Three- and especially four-player games can be a little more tactical, but I find it fun trying to get into other players’ heads and predict their moves while scheming my own. Azul also has double-sided player boards, one with a preprinted mosaic and one with a blank mosaic. Personally, there’s enough to think about with the preprinted side that I haven’t found it necessary to play on the blank side, but it’s there for players who want it.


The insert for Azul is beautiful as well as functional. This is truly a wonderful package.


No discussion of Azul is complete without a discussion of the components, which are simply excellent. The small Starburst-sized resin tiles are colorful and satisfying to take and place and look beautiful on the table. The factory “coasters” are well illustrated and perform their function well. The player boards are thick and sturdy, and if the cube is a bit workmanlike compared to the rest of the components, it at least performs its function well. The draw bag is big enough to accommodate the tiles and give them a shuffle. All told, the components here are worthy and serve to elevate the game. Much like Splendor , another newcomer to the evergreen gateway pantheon, Azul would be a good game without these stunning components, but it likely wouldn’t receive the attention it has gotten. Azul combines form and function in a pleasing package that is nevertheless affordable–a big win.


Each Azul board is double sided. This is the blank variant. Players can fill it any way they want to, but each color can be represented only once in each row and column (as on the main board).


I really like Azul–it’s simple, it’s clever, and it’s a game that has gone over well with everyone I’ve taught it to. My only reservation about it is the same reservation I have about most abstracts, and that is that the game is great fun to play while you’re playing it, but it leaves very little in the way of pleasing aftertaste. Azul is good, even compelling, but not much more. Azul is fun, then it’s over, and you’re likely to be on to the next thing. It’s possible to make clever moves, and to feel good about them, but they’re not the kind of moves that are likely to go down in your group’s gaming annals, like the Great Ra  Gambit of 2015 or That Time Regret Won the Winner’s Circle  Race in Two Moves or The Time We Magically Played Eight Cards in a Row in The Mind . Azul is pleasant, fun, and engaging, but it’s not the stuff memories are made of. Of course, not every game needs to provide epic moments to be worth its place in your collection, and it’s probably enough that Azul is so consistent at doing what it does well. I would just expect the stuff that sticks with you to come from the chatter that happens before, during, or after the game rather than what happens at the board.

And that’s fine. Azul is a game that consistently provides a great experience for a wide range of players. It’s a game I’m always happy to play and will even suggest, and I don’t have to endure the boos or blackballs of sour gamers every time it’s mentioned–a big win. Even though I’m a merciless collection culler, Azul is a game I intend to keep, and I expect it to be in frequent rotation at family get-togethers because it’s the kind of game that’s easy to share with those you love. It’s a fun and engaging game that gives you an excuse to sit down with people whose company you enjoy and spend time with them, having fun yourself in the process. There’s nothing wrong, and a great deal right, with that.

Hey Mike,

The game was a nice surprise in my inbox this morning. I love Azul so I'm really looking forward to giving this a try so I thought I'd share the news. I have the base Azul and bought both tile sets and joker tiles so count me in to anything Next Move Games or Plan B releases!

The only thing I'm missing is the upcoming Kings of Coral expansion for Reef because I missed the preorder window. I pre-ordered it elsewhere because of that which is a bummer.

Thanks,

So they may very well "feel" solid on the outside and yet still be hollow inside. I have some solid bakelite mahjong tiles that were quite expensive and I can tell you that they weigh quite a bit more than these Azul tiles do. So they may very well be partly hollow inside.

You're spot on. We use an exclusive distributor for hobby and mass market. One of the benefits is controlling the volume of titles being brought in. With a limited two points of entry, it's not very likely counterfeits will slide in with ease (that being said, they are tricky - I would be most concerned with affliation sales, such as Amazon, as that's historical been the area easiest to exploit.

Tema 410: ALL RED TILES missing from game! (Plan B Games)
Pregunta:
I've written 3 emails in the past couple of weeks to Plan B games, with pictures attached, asking them to send the missing bag of 20 red tiles to me but have had no reply! This is as much a plea to plan B games as anything! Below r pictures of the box contents, as well as us using qwirkle pieces in their stead, and amazon.com delivery note as proof of purchase. If someone from plan B games can reply to this, or email me at bsjg@hotmail.co.uk , then we can sort out getting this resolved!

Many thanks, Sub21x

I haven't returned all that much stuff to Amazon.com, but I'm pretty sure that when you have a defective/damaged item and you want a replacement, they pay the return shipping (or tell you to just keep it) and send you a new one. Otherwise, they pay the return shipping (or tell you to just keep it) and give you a full refund (including the original shipping). It's certainly worth initiating a return from your account page and seeing what happens. It's probably also covered on the Amazon.com FAQ.

Tema 412: End Game Scoring
Pregunta:
I apologize in advance if this has already been asked but I tried searching for it and couldn’t find it anywhere.

Is the floor tile scoring considered a part of the wall tiling phase and counted towards the end game scoring? Basically, do I have to deduct the points just as I would from every other round (if applicable of course)? Or do you only calculate the points for your completed wall tile scoring?

My gut says that you should count the deductions of the floor tile scoring.

Thanks in advance!

You finish the last round. This includes doing the scoring for the last round, including deducting points for tiles on the floor.

Then do end game scoring to get bonuses for completed rows, columns, and colors.

Gameplay
The game is played over multiple rounds, each of which is
composed of three phases:
A. Factory offer
B. Wall-tiling
C. Preparing the next round

...

End of the game
The game ends right after the Wall-tiling phase in which at least
one player has completed at least one horizontal line of
5 consecutive tiles on her wall.
Wall-tiling includes scoring your floor tiles.

Wall-tiling includes scoring your floor tiles.
Page 5 begins with the heading "Scoring" in bold. It really is a component under the earlier page 4 heading "B. Wall-tiling".

This quote comes from within "Scoring"

Finally at the end of the Wall-Tiling phase, check if you have any tiles in your floor line. For each tile in your floor line, you lose the number of pointes indicated directly above it.

Chaos cards in the UK have just popped up saying they now have Azul in stock. The product code suggests it will be the first edition which is unusual as I thought they were sold out everywhere so if anyone can confirm that would be great.

Tema 415: Which version do you prefer - the official rules or the official variant rules?
Pregunta:
I've not played the game yet, but I have a question - As the thread title asks - which do you prefer? The normal "colourful" side of the board or the "greyed out" variant side?

Respuesta 1:
I'm actually tiring of the colorful side...Have only played the grey side once...So, to continue to enjoy & play Azul, I think I'll give the grey side more attention. Also, while Azul is a fun game - I don't always agree with any high ratings it recieves. For me it lost replay quickly.

Respuesta 2:
The colorful side is much easier for new players to understand. It is also a bit of a "lighther" game for experiences players. The Grey side allows for more scoring but at the same time the ability to put yourself into a bad situation.

Although abstract is not my favorite genre, Azul is my most played game and one of my favorites. I enjoy both sides of the board but tend to prefer the grey side.

Respuesta 3:
I prefer the color side because you can predict what the other players may take.

Respuesta 4:
I haven't tired of the colourful side yet. Will try the non-coloured side at some stage in the future.

Respuesta 5:
both equally. both are diferent in play style and I switch them equally.

I was quickly bored of the colored side, but have played many on the gray side and don’t see an end in site with the variety it opens up.

Tema 417: Uneven Number Of Turns
Pregunta:
Hi all,

I was playing Azul yesterday for the first time and I noticed that at least twice during the game others players ended up having more turns than I did. I was not the first player for these rounds, but neither were the other two people besides me (it was a 4 player game) yet at least one of them would have an extra (final) turn along with the starting player. Is this the way it’s supposed to be? Has anyone else experienced this? It made me feel as if there was a weird disadvantage there and I ended up losing to one of the players who got to play more turns before (even when he wasn’t the starting player).

Looking forward to hearing what others think, thanks!

Respuesta 1:
Having more turns is not necessarily a good thing.

Respuesta 2:
Dan Blum
@tool
Having more turns is not necessarily a good thing.
So very true. Usually the last people to get turns are often stuck with tiles they can’t use. Keep playing and you’ll see what we mean.

Respuesta 3:
The round continues until all tiles are taken, and players might take various numbers of tiles on their turns, so of course there's no guarantee that the number of turns will be evenly divisible by the number of players.

Respuesta 4:
That's part of the game's strategy. Trying to predict who will get stuck with the middle tiles on the last turn....for better or worse.... and then try to come up with a strategy for which tiles you choose before then you think will best benefit your positioning re; that last turn.

Do I take the 2 blue tiles I can use now and potentially get stuck with the 4 black ones in the middle on the last turn, all of which I would have to place in my "broken tile" stack, or do I take the 3 red ones of which I can only use 2 and take a "hit" of one broken tile now to avoid that?

Respuesta 5:
Thank you very much for your help, guys! I’ll play some more and see how it goes!



Tema 418: The Office lays some tiles in Azul
Pregunta:
This session report is part of a continuing series where I describe the games being played as part of our Game Lunch Fridays during the lunch break of a business office. Our lunch break is only thirty minutes, so our game choices are limited to games that can be taught and played in a short time.

For our Game Lunch Friday this week, I brought in Azul. I had talk about the game numerous times before at work and really wanted to share this game with my co-workers. I was a little concerned about playing four players only (sometimes I have five or more players on Game Lunch Friday). I was also concerned that the game would take longer than 30 minutes. With all four players, it was likely to happen, especially as they were new players and I had rules to explain. So I decided to prepare for the game a little differently. I confirmed ahead of time who would be able to make the game: My three regulars – Pat, Bill, and Corietha – were the only ones who could make it (which made it perfect for the four-player game). Next, I scheduled the game on a Friday with light activities in case the game ran long. Finally, I scheduled a Thursday Lunch Game Rules session where I covered the rules of the game ahead of time. It did not take long to do, but it was time I did not want to waste on Friday. Because we took the time on Thursday to go over the rules, we were also able to play a practice round so everyone could get the feel of how the game flowed.

I was not sure how I would record the game session (and I was surprised that this very popular game had no session reports), so I created a worksheet to track each turn .

On the day of play, one of my other co-workers (Vince) was unexpectedly able to play and really wanted to play the game. Bill graciously sat the game out and listened in. Unfortunately, it also meant I had to explain the rules quickly so he could play.

Below is a blank player board set up I will use to illustrate each round of play.


Blank Tableau Setup






Tiles

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


Round 1 Vince got off to a very strong start.

Me Score: 4 (First)






Pat Score: 3






Corietha Score: 2






Vince Score: 6





--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------



Round 2

Me Score: 12






Pat Score: 6






Corietha Score: 7






Vince Score: 18 (first)





--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


Round 3

Me Score: 22






Pat Score: 15 (first) I believe this was the round Pat ended up eating four broken tiles – He was the only one the entire game to suffer that consequence.






Corietha Score: 20






Vince Score: 27





--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------



Round 4

Me Score: 37 (first)






Pat Score: 40






Corietha Score: 40






Vince Score: 44





--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------



Round 5 We knew this was most likely the last round as three of the four players had all but one tile left to complete five tiles across.

Me Score: 57 + 7+7 +10 == 81 final and winner






Pat Score: 53+2 == 55 final Pat took the last yellow just to prevent Corietha from finishing her row of four and her set of five. She was not happy about that!






Corietha Score: 55 +2 == 57 final






Vince Score: 54 +2 +7 + 10 == 73 final (first)






The group greatly enjoyed the game and announced that it would be one to return later when we bring back a previously played game for our Game Lunch Fridays. Vince took a picture of the game so he could go purchase it for his family. We finished the game in 40 minutes including the brief rules explanation at the front. I did take a few moments in between rounds taking notes of the player boards so I could complete the session report, so that may have consumed five of the total minutes playing. We should be able to play the game next time in under thirty minutes. Great game.

Tema 420: Component upgrades?
Pregunta:
I absolutely love this game and am hoping to "bling" my copy. I've found a few sites (and one BGG member) selling acrylic overlays, but I'd really like to find three things:

1) Actual coasters to replace the center factories, with the same design as the cardboard pieces.

2) Smaller player boards with no scoring track. I'm very tempted to try using an X-acto knife to trim down the existing boards.

3) A nicer score tracking system, perhaps a set of MtG-style spindown life counters that go up to 99 and match Azul's aesthetic.

Leads on any of these upgrades greatly appreciated, especially the coasters!

Respuesta 1:
You can have any image you like printed on a coaster at Artscow:

As for the player boards, you could have those custom printed on your own mats. That would be a nice upgrade in addition to being able to get rid of the score tracks.

Have you considered a four-track cribbage board? That's what I'm using. The nice thing about this is that you can tell at a glance who is in the lead (if that matters to you!).

Alternately, you could get cubes in for different colors and use one of the (now separated) score tracks to track all the players' scores. It would certainly match the aesthetic...

Respuesta 5:
I am manufacturing my own Azul board, which will allow me to play the game without the (greatly disliked) scoretracks. The Factory Tiles aren't needed either, although they can be placed on the board if so desired.

The board will be a hardwood circle, with a decorated ceramic tile in the centre and a mosaic tile scoretrack around the perimeter. All tiles will be rebated into the board and grouted to achieve a smooth and flush surface. Players' score markers will likely be mosaics mounted on wooden bases.

Images of a rough prototype can be seen below.

Tiles going in the box mean that you cycle through all the tiles. That's the rule and is therefore the way the game is meant to be played.

Uhm, when tiles are dropped to the floor (can not be placed) they don't go back into the bag, but have to be stored elsewhere (rules suggest the box lid) until the bag is completely empty. That way you are guaranteed to draw every single tile from each color, and know exactly how many are still in the bag / available for the next rounds.

We use a quart-sized measuring cup with a pouring spout in place of the box lid, and literally pour the tiles back into the bag. Works extremely well.

The discard pile is supposed to be public (open) information so putting the tiles into a bag would defeat the purpose. We just put discarded tiles into the box lid and then transfer them all back to the bag when it's time to recycle.

Respuesta 13:
I'm planning a circle of cloth about a foot across, with grommets around the edge and a string through them all.

Smooth it out, place the discards on it, let people see and rummage all they want, but when it's full you just pull the string, and it's a bag for the next round.

Saves the annoying part of filing the bag from the box.

Respuesta 14:
Interesting idea--in our second game when dumping the discards from the box into the bag they went everywhere, hence the look for a smoother solution...

It can be useful at times. If you are considering which colors to try to pull, you can scan the discard pile and see how many are already gone. Given there is a fixed (and equal) number of each type of tile, it can let you know how many of each are still in the bag to be drawn. It can keep you from trying to reach a goal that would never be completed.

Tema 421: The Anti-Strategy Strategy, for the HARD side (a paradox of sorts)

Exactly, that's been our impression as well. After overcoming the initial pitfalls of the blank side, we have found it to be, well, just a side with much fewer restrictions on your placement.

So, we actually mostly play the preset side these days, although the blank side is fun once in a while for variation.

In the end we compromised by letting each player choose the side side they wanted to play with instead of making everyone use the same.
I would think the blank side players would have a distinct advantage.

Respuesta 6:
Has anybody looked closely into how the blank side facilitates a "top two rush" by allowing a two-cycle plus a 3-cycle, as opposed to mandating a 5-cycle? Meaning you could start your first two rounds with a centralized square of the same two colors:

- - B Y -
- - Y B -

for maximum placement points combined with huge flexibility on the third round: any two of three colors in counts of 1 and 2 (virtually certain), and which are guaranteed to maximize placement points by going in column 2.

Of course, the player intending the rush will also probably have partially filled rows 3-5, and aggressive defense can make them take some minuses. But that's in the nature of a rush strategy, after all. Calculate closely to eke out the win.



Tema 422: Multiple Complete Pattern Lines and Horizontal Wall Tile Lines?
Pregunta:
Greetings

We played our first session of Azul last night and really like the game. But there was one thing that bothered us. The rules state very explicitly that when you pick tiles you place them in one pattern line. In the wall tiling phase you move the right most tile from a complete pattern line to the wall then discard the remaining tiles.

But in two places the rules allude to having more than one complete pattern line. The first place is in the section describing the tiling phase where one example shows the player moving two tiles from two complete pattern lines over the their wall. Then in the scoring phase, you get 2 points for each complete horizontal line you have, even though the rules state very clearly the game ends once any player completes ONE horizontal line on their wall.

Our only guess was that a player could simply allow tiles to pile up in the pattern lines until a player felt like moving tiles over to their wall. Is this correct or is there some other explanation for how a person could have have multiple complete pattern lines or horizontal wall tile lines?

Thx in advance.

Respuesta 1:
I've had 3 or 4 tile lines complete on the same turn many times. It only takes 1 tile to complete the top line and one 2 tiles to complete the second and so on. Then lines that aren't completed on a turn remain there until they are complete, so often it takes only 1 or 2 of those in a turn to complete a line.

Respuesta 2:
i think you got one or more major rules wrong.
I would suggest you to watch a video rule explanation, there are several really good.

Respuesta 3:
The explanation is that you complete the whole round in which someone completes a horizontal line. You don't end immediately on one line being completed.

Respuesta 4:
And you only start moving tiles to the wall AFTER all tiles for this round have been picked. Each pick may go to a different pattern line.

It does sound like you have some major rule misunderstanding.

The implication of your response and the other responses above is that in one round, people take multiple turns taking tiles form the factory displays but I don't see anything in the rules to suggest that was what was supposed to be happening. Reading and re-reading the rules I don't see anything that instructs players to take multiple turns picking tiles during the Factory Offer phase.

The game is played over multiple rounds, each of which is
composed of three phases:
A. Factory offer
B. Wall-tiling
C. Preparing the next round

A. Factory offer
The starting player places the starting player marker in the
center of the table and then takes the first turn. Play then
continues clockwise.
On your turn, you must pick tiles in one of the following ways:
...
Your goal in this phase is to complete as many of your pattern
lines as you can, because during the following Wall-tiling phase,
you will only be able to move tiles from complete pattern lines to
their corresponding lines on your wall to score points.

This phase ends when the center of the table AND all Factory

Then, continue with the Wall-tiling phase.

This quote under the "Floor line" heading gives you an alternative (their bold, my highlight)

Any tiles you have picked that you cannot or do not want to place according to the rules, you must place in your floor line, filling its spaces from left to right.


Example C in the diagram that follows also shows, "she may even choose to place both tiles in the floor line (C)."

Tema 424: Story Board reviews Azul
Pregunta:
This review was originally published here:
https://storyboardgamer.com/2017/11/15/azul/

No replication without permission

You are builders commissioned by King Manuel I to decorate the Portuguese Palace of Evora. Your commission comes in the wake of his visit to the Spanish Palace, the Alhambra. It featured a dazzling display of the moorish azuljeros tiles. Your task is to emulate that most wonderful display.

Azul is a tile placement game. You are decorating the palace wall with elaborate tiles, piece-by-piece. You take turns to select batches of tiles from central offerings, which you must then allocate to build queues. If you complete a build queue, you place a tile on the palace wall to earn points based on any lines you create.



Gameplay

Your goal is to earn points by placing tiles in pleasing configurations on the wall of the Evora Palace. You earn points during the tile placement phase, when you move tiles to the wall space from the build queue. You will earn more points by ensuring placements form congruent vertical and horizontal lines.

Each round, you have opportunities to collect tiles from the central area for any of your open build queues. There are two options, you can either collect tiles from one of the factory offerings (the round disks), or from the growing pool of tiles in the centre of the play area. When you take tiles, you must take all of one colour in the chosen space. If this was a factory offering, any remaining tiles move to the central pool.

In allocating your tiles to build queues, you may only assign them to one row (you cannot split tiles across multiple rows). If you have excess tiles, they move to the penalty row. In allocating tiles, you may not assign tiles to a row where you have completed that colour in a previous round. Although you can assign tiles of matching colour to currently incomplete rows.

A round of play continues until all available tiles are taken. You must take tiles even if you have no place to put them, where you would allocate them all to the penalty row. Once you have concluded the acquisition phase of the game, you can score any completed build queue. You take one tile from each completed row, and move it to its respective space on the wall. At this point, you earn points based on the height and width of any column or row they form (solitary tiles just score 1 point).

You will continue to play across multiple rounds, until one player manages to complete a full row, which triggers the end of the game. Once you have completed the current round’s scoring, you earn some bonus points. Two extra points for a complete row, seven extra points for a complete column, and ten extra points for all of one colour complete.



Experience

Azul is one of the few games that I would apply the term ‘elegance of game design’ to. The choices are very structured, as it is not just what you take that is important, but also what you leave behind. It is easy enough to build towards your own goals, but more experienced players are likely be looking for ways to block their competitors.

Chess has a term for this: Zugzwang. It compels your opponent to make choices between multiple sub-optimal or even terrible moves. A good game of Azul is exactly this, as you can make smart choices that help you a little but dramatically damage your opponent due as you either block or force their hand. This dynamic is accentuated in the two-player game.

A particular trap for new players is not clearing rows efficiently. For every uncleared row at the end of a round, that is one line you have committed to at the start of the next round. This can be very onerous for your bottom two rows, as they can help you soak large tile collection that happens towards the end of the round.

As tiles accumulate in the centre, you encounter a mounting possibility of being forced to take a large selection of tiles that you cannot legally place. You must assign these wasted tiles to your penalty row, and a single round with a full penalty can put you behind on the lead. Given these severe penalties for waste, you must apply care towards the end game as you are increasingly painted into corners

This game holds a place as a casual game, but one that offers more strategic depths. The game will reward more experienced players, and generally give an edge to those who can perceive the strategy in blocking and forcing an opponent’s hand. You also learn to take some acceptable losses, with a lesser penalty that prevents you from taking a greater one.

This game provides an excellent medium-light challenge with a solid core game experience. Having been nominated for the Spiel des Jahres, I am certain that this game will prove to be an evergreen in the years to come.

Verdict

I have added this game to my collection, and I recommend you seek it out.

Tema 425: Azul in the UK
Pregunta:
So i have been looking for this game now for over a month, at first i balked at the elevated prices of around £40-£50 for a game that retails lower than that.

But now we are looking at prices of more than £80 to buy a copy of this game in the UK.

I understand that the people who make this game do not get to set any price other than the RRP, but is there that few copies being distributed that it drives the price that high?

I could also understand if it was a game that was a bit niche, and not as popular as others, but it is constantly talked about in groups i talk to yet nobody really wants to spend nearly triple to RRP to own this game.

I know there may be a new print shortly(as mentioned in a previous thread), but that will of zero use if there are only very limited copies being distributed to the UK market.

I have contacted the UK distributers, but had absolutely no respense at all, but surely as a distributer of games they can view what is in demand and what isn't?

I find that to be not the case, the main stores that stock games in my area(less than a 45 minute drive) often price games well above the RRP as they know if they are not available online, they match the game price that is being asked by ebayers and amazon sellers, and this appears to be more and more common.

The game was available for me to purchase at £45 from Amazon UK reseller, but i declined as im not a fan of paying above RRP for a game, and yet due to its limited availability in the UK, those who did snap up a copy, seem to now be trying to sell(*cough* con) people into paying well over the odds for it.

I understand supply and demand, i just dont understand why this game is so poorly stocked in the UK considering its popularity and the increasing popularity of board games in general.

So i have been looking for this game now for over a month, at first i balked at the elevated prices of around £40-£50 for a game that retails lower than that.

But now we are looking at prices of more than £80 to buy a copy of this game in the UK.

I understand that the people who make this game do not get to set any price other than the RRP, but is there that few copies being distributed that it drives the price that high?

I could also understand if it was a game that was a bit niche, and not as popular as others, but it is constantly talked about in groups i talk to yet nobody really wants to spend nearly triple to RRP to own this game.

I know there may be a new print shortly(as mentioned in a previous thread), but that will of zero use if there are only very limited copies being distributed to the UK market.

I have contacted the UK distributers, but had absolutely no respense at all, but surely as a distributer of games they can view what is in demand and what isn't?

HELP!
You can order it from Amazon.com (US). I checked the cost to the UK and it will be:
$36.18 + $17.82 Shipping & Import Fees Deposit to United Kingdom
https://www.amazon.com/dp/B077MZ2MPW/ref=sxts_k2p-hero-vn_bs...

Your Amazon.co.uk login and password will work, you will be given the choice of paying in dollars or pounds, so there's no exchange fee.

So that's roughly $55 / £41 including shipping to the UK and taxes, which isn't a bad deal. FWIW, it's always worth checking Amazon.com for some of this stuff, the same as it's worth it for people in the US to check book depository or Amazon.de -- Amazon's international shipping is a bargain and it's great to avoid the exchange rake a lot of credit cards have.

This thread is not a dig at the publishers, they obviously can only produce "x" amount of games per run, but more why UK distributers may seem to be intentionally keeping stock low to raise the price on an industry that is thriving at the moment.

Yep, frustrating! I am also looking to buy a copy.

However, looking at some German and French sites have pre-orders set for around 20th of June to arrive so I'm hoping this is the same for the UK distributor.

Approx £41 to ship a copy from the US isn't too bad - I guess from Amazon directly it's a bit safer if something goes wrong in shipping it at least. But worth waiting a bit more I think...

Respuesta 15:
I would guess/hope that Asmodee UK is aware how much buzz Azul is getting and has ordered a print run to match the hype. Hopefully games will start turning up in the next couple of months and in sufficient numbers that everyone gets a copy. Assuming that is the case, the balance between supply and demand should ensure prices drop to a more reasonable average. In the meantime, I'll just wait as patiently as possible.

I honestly think the only way you're going to get it at this point will be to buy a new copy of the game (which includes the tile) and resell your current copy. Otherwise, you might be stuck with cardboard. The publisher has stated that they probably won't be offering more.

Good news, that is a small fraction of the overall sales of Azul. We have went on to sell out of 4 additional print runs since then pushing the total of Next Move labeled Azul in the neighborhood of around 350,000+ units. Odds are you’ll get a Next Move version.

Regardless of what is advisable, if the OP wishes to score bonuses the instant they are achieved, it would make absolutely no difference to the scoring. So to answer the OP's final question, no, you're not missing part of the equation.

Whilst I have no desire for in-game bonus scoring, I do agree that Azul's decentralised scorekeeping is a poor design choice.

The suggestion is meant to avoid accidental misses of scoring (which tends to happen) or double scoring (which also tends to happen). The vast majority of players would likely be unaffected, but the chance exists. IMO, donas you wish. Just make sure sure you are uniform. You may want to develop a scoring script - "how many points for placed tiles, did you score bonus X, Y, Z?" To help prevent accidents.

Respuesta 5:
It could add confusion to the game to score in game. What if by accident you or someone you play with double scores the same bonus by accident.

But if you can keep track of it, no it changes nothing about the game. I personally like that the bonuses are scored at the end. It’s not difficult to look over at other’s boards and see how many bonus points they’ll score.

Consider this [unlikely but possible] scenario:

End of the second round, you have just completed the first column on your board, having a total of 11 points gained from placing those tiles over two rounds. (round 1 was row 1, 3, 5; round 2 was row 2, 4.) However, at the end of the second round, your floor row is also completely full of tiles, so you also receive -14 points.

If the points are added in the order described in the rulebook, your score would be 11-14 = 0 (because you cannot go below zero), +7 at the end of the game

If the points from the bonus was added immediately (ie: as soon as you fulfill the condition), your score would be 11+7-14 = 4

Plus, scoring bonuses at the end makes sure you can never lose those points on a turn where you have to take negative points from your row of discarded tiles.
Oops, my friends and I have been scoring bonuses every round where there was a completed vertical column or 5-of-a-kind. We always scored 12 points for the columns, since placing the fifth tile (usually not adjacent horizontally) would be five points and the bonus is 7.

We’re also new to Azul...



Tema 431: Starting Player Deficit
Pregunta:
The rules state the starting player must take the first player tile. If this is not going to be put in his floor line as a negative deficit, then why take the tile?

Doesn't the tile just get placed in the center of the table at the beginning of the game?

It does just get placed in the center at the beginning of the game. Then when a player takes tiles from the center for the first time, they also place the starting tile on their floor. The next round, that player is the first player.

The starting player of the game is exempt from this rule. As noted the determination is based on last visiting Portugal.

The tile is placed at th center of the table until someone drafts from there.

I find this sequence in the rules. Page 2, in the "Game Setup" section, the Start Player takes posession

5. The player who most recently visited Portugal takes the
starting player marker (F) and then fills each Factory
display with exactly 4 tiles randomly drawn from the bag.


The accompanying diagram shows item F placed beside the player board. Not on the Floor line.

In the "Game Play" section on page 3, the marker moves to the center of the table.

A. Factory offer
The starting player places the starting player marker in the
center of the table and then takes the first turn. Play then
continues clockwise.

Tema 434: Giant Azul - Pre-orders now open!
Pregunta:
To commemorate Azul receiving the Spiel des Jahres nomination, Next Move Games is offering the opportunity for fans to order Azul Giant edition! Azul’s components have been enlarged by 200% providing players a unique play experience. To complement the larger size, the original player boards have been replaced with neoprene mats with more vibrant colors than original game boards. Lastly, a special edition game like this requires an amazing storage solution. Giant Azul is transported and stored in a custom designed suitcase patterned after the Azul cover art and includes removable tray inserts.

We could use the help of some tile laying artisans! To produce such an extraordinary title, we are establishing a 30 day pre-order system to find only the most dedicated fans wiling to order. This is where you come in. If we’re able to secure at least 500 committed tile artisans by June 21 – We will activate the print run. If we don’t, all preorders will be cancelled.

What do you say, can we count you in?

Tema 435: A Negative Review of Azul
Pregunta:
I've heard of or seen Azul a few times here and there. I didn't investigate it as there wasn't anything about the name or box or anything I have heard that piqued my interest. I ended up getting a chance to play it with some friends. The friend who owns the game has a wide selection of games. His collection includes games I probably would not actively choose to play or try out. He has introduced some games outside of the usual type of games I would normally play or seek out. A number of them I end up liking. Azul ended up not being one of those.

Azul is an abstract tile laying game. There are 5 types of tiles. Each player has a 5x5 board which each square on the board matching one of the 5 types of tiles. There are 5 of each type of tile on each board. No row or column has more than one type. The object of the game is to score points by laying tiles on the board matching the square on the board.

The quality of the tiles are very good. The 5 types of tiles are not only in different colours, but also some have different designs on them and some are plain. I get the impression that the choice of colours and design are so it makes it easier for people who are colour blind.

Each round begins with 4 tiles placed on each of a number of factories. The number of factories depends on the number of players. When you draft tiles, you may draft from a factory. You choose a colour and all tiles of that colour you gain and place the tiles to right of the row you want to place the tile. If you already have tiles drafted, they must go on that row and any excess results in negative points. The tiles not of the colour in that factory go to the middle. Players can choose to draft from the middle of the board as well. The tiles not of the type you want to draft from the factory go into the middle of the table.

In each subsequent turn, the next player may draft from a factory with tiles left or from the middle of the table the same way. Select the type of tile and draft them. If it is from a factory, the undrafted ones go in the middle. If you draft from the middle, the tiles not of the type you want remain in the middle. Drafting continues until all tiles are drafted after which you place your tiles on your player board.

In order to lay a tile on your board, you must draft tiles of the same type equal to the row number. To place a tile on the first row, you must end up drafting in that round 1 tile of the type you want to place in that row. To place a tile on the second row, you must end up drafting in that round 2 tiles of the type you want to place, and so on to the 5th row. Remember you can only place one type of tile on each row and each column. If you draft too many of a type of tile, you end up losing points for excess tiles you drafted. Also, in any given round, you are only allowed to place at most one tile of each type. If you are drafting a type of tile for one row, you cannot also draft it for another row in the same round. These constraints force you to plan ahead in how you draft tiles and which row you choose to place them in.

After the drafting is done, if you draft enough tiles for a row, you may place it in the square of that row representing that tile type. You score points for placing the tiles. You get more for placing them adjacent and forming horizontal rows and columns. You usually want to place them adjacent to other tiles as this would score more points.

The game ends when one player manages to complete an entire row of 5 tiles. There is also various endgame scoring with rows and columns of 5 or 5 tiles of one type.

The strategy is to try to draft the right number of tiles. Also, you want to avoid getting stuck drafting tiles that cause you to lose points. I find that you want to look ahead, figure out what other players may want to draft and what may be left when it comes around to you again.

I do generally prefer sci-fi/fantasy themed games, but the theme of Azul or lack thereof wasn't a problem for me. The game does feature important and interesting decisions on what to draft. The game does reward you for wisely choosing which tiles to draft when it comes to your turn. The game rewards you for choosing where to place the tiles you draft. The game makes you want to plan out the next few turns (yours and your opponents).

Part way through the game, I just couldn't take playing the game anymore. It seemed all that effort I put into planning my moves in a round just netted me some point. The next round was the same. It just felt really repetitive with the payoff not really worth the effort I was putting in. There wasn't something that was really cool I felt I could experience continuing the game. I actually reached a point in the game where I decided I was just going to end the game as soon as possible beyond doing anything else. The only saving grace was I saw how I could end the game in the next 2 rounds and I did so over doing anything else.

I just felt that I would have more fun playing bingo than playing this game. I did put my effort into playing this game for most of the game. In the end, I began to realise there just wasn't enough excitement in what I got or what I could potentially get to be worth any more effort.

I looked at a number of other reviews on Azul just to make sure I didn't play it wrong or if there was something else I may be missing. It seemed I played it correctly and there was nothing else I missed. I also did check if there were others who felt the same way. There were some on BGG who also did not like it but we appear to be in a very small minority.

After my experience, I really felt the need to write down my thoughts about this game. Games that evoke strong emotions from me and inspire me to write about it tend to be ones I really like or really hate. Unfortunately it is the latter for Azul.

Update: 2018-05-21

I've been told that I played this game incorrectly by some of the members here. As it would not be a fair review if I played this game incorrectly, I am going to seek out the rules and read them. The game was introduced to me by someone else who taught me the game. I'll ask my friend to play it again once I have reviewed the rules.

I dislike Azul, but for a different reason. It feels incredibly stressful, trying to keep track of your opponents in order to avoid being stuck with a load of negative points, while at the same time trying to order your tiles properly in order to score the most points.

It can also be rather ruthless when people start adding more tiles to the centre on purpose, knowing that sooner or later someone will be very very screwed. You can purposely take tiles that won't help you, in order to force your opponent to lose a lot more. For example, I'll take this one tile you need and lose a point, so you are forced to take those 3 tiles you don't need and lose even more points.

Azul comes across as a pretty, innocent-looking game, but under the patterns lie a beast just waiting to be unleashed.

It seemed I played it correctly and there was nothing else I missed. I also did check if there were others who felt the same way. There were some on BGG who also did not like it but we appear to be in a very small minority.
Well, thanks for the effort of checking other reviews, but it seems you did miss a few things and actually played wrong. Best source might not be other reviews, but the rule book.

Might want to play with the correct rules, maybe you like it then. Even if not, that's totally fine, I just wanted to point out the rules mistake for others who might.
I guess the mistakes are very big to overlook.
The Op didn't play Azul, he played some weird variant that apparently it's not good.

Design Goals: Develop a variant that gives the game a little more meat and depth.


Preface:

I knew that there would be a day that I would pick up Azul. Not because it is the best thing around or some deep experience but because it is the perfect spouse/ mother/daughter game. There are almost no rules and yet much like playing dominoes (which I don’t enjoy) you get that tactile, social experience. Sometimes this is what makes for a perfect gaming night.

SoloPlay Azul Design Comments:

Due to the game’s simplicity there is always a concern that there is not enough design space to build a decent variant around. I take this as a challenge much like The Game of 49. I started with the “Patchwork” idea but it was not working right and just felt like moving pieces around. It was not very interesting.

I then went too far the other direction and the thing was a mess. I was moving to far away from the core design. Then something clicked in my mind that I needed to utilize the floor lines of each board. This started me on the right track and when I came up with the action matrix, I was all in.

What is a Penalty Row?:

I knew that I was going to need to use 2 boards otherwise there was not enough design space to develop the variant. I then went with the 5 factory displays like a 2-player game. I set up the game to play it out and it was too open. The center pool was not going to work. What to do?

This is when I called one board the action board and the other the player (scoring) board. Each board had a different gaming purpose. I knew I needed something where you had to make real decisions and the action board gave me that. Development stopped while I parsed all of the tools at my fingertips.

I placed pieces onto the factory line and thought about using this as a way to develop the action board in a sequence to enhance scoring. From the first play this worked great and the factory line on the action board was now known as the penalty row. I had now put a 50lb weight around my neck right from the start with the goal to remove it.

Then came the actions:

Still focusing on the action board I needed to give it more of a purpose than just for shuffling tiles. I determined how each line could be used to impact the penalty row. There was just enough space in the variant design to create the appropriate actions for each of the 5 lines. This was starting to become very interesting as I was now trying to build combos with the tiles. Combos in Azul? Oh, yeah!

The first time you pull off a 4 action combo you can’t resist performing a fist pump. The first 5 tiles in my penalty row are blue, red, orange, orange and black. I don’t have enough blue to work with but red is on the 3rd line and there is enough black to complete the fourth line. I can do this.

I take a blue to fill the top line (1 tile), take 2 orange for the 2nd line, place the 1 red to finish the 3rd line and then take 2 black twice to finish the fourth line of the action board. At the same time I am placing tiles on my scoring board. Just focusing on the actions here …

Resolving the actions I take the one tile action: return the first tile to the bag and draw a new one for the end of the line. I discard the blue and as luck would have it I draw another blue but now it is at the end of the line (out of the way). I then need to switch tiles to move black up a position using the 2 tile action line(switch 2 neighboring penalty row tiles). I switch the positions of the 2nd orange and the black tile. I now have red in the first position, orange in the second, black in the third, orange and blue in the fourth and fifth positions respectfully.

3 tile action: remove matching first tile from the penalty row. I move a red to the action board wall and then remove the red from the penalty row. This slides all tiles up. I then resolve the 4 tile action (moving a black tile to the wall) and since the black is in the 2nd position I can remove it from the penalty row. Removing 2 tiles from the penalty row is a great turn as it reduced my negative scoring by 4 for the current round.

Now I know that many of you may not be able to follow what just happened but hopefully you will be able to experience something like this. The point was that I was more invested and felt I had more control of how the game was going to play out. This was shaping up to be something cool.

… but what about the 1st player tile?:

As I am a no piece left behind kind of variant designer, I knew that I needed to come up with something. I first tried using it as a reshuffle tile but this created too much variance. Accidentally I placed the tile on the action board and it came to me. This is a way to make the action board a little different and create a new scoring opportunity. It was a simple thing and something where you are now balancing the actions against scoring. If you can get the full 11 points off of the tile (I have not yet done this) can provide a huge lift towards victory. It is definitely something to take note of.

And then it was just play after play after play. The whole game plays in 20-30 minutes tops so I could rip out 5+ games a night and it held up really well. A few end game scoring opportunities were put in to ensure that you cannot tunnel too hard on one strategy.

After this it was a couple nights of typing and editing and it’s done. Another easy variant in the can.

Goal of the rule design

1. Increase the strategic possibilities of the game
2. Increase the game’s variability
3. Increase the design space and give the player more to do


Comments are always welcome.

Strategies:
1. Focus on the action board. You have to know how they are going to help you and maybe give you a little scoring in the process.
2. You still have to score all the while trimming back the scoring penalty each round. Even when the penalty hits zero you still have to worry about it due to the way the actions change for the 1st and 2nd lines.
3. Can you get to where you will play 8 instead of 7 rounds? Will you be successful? Will it make a difference?


Final Thoughts
Some variant designs just show the possibilities early on in this process. This one was like a pistachio that had not started to burst from its shell yet. I held to put a little pressure on it to bring out the goodness. Once in the open, I could not stop with just one.


Setup time: <5 minutes

Play time: about 20-30 minutes.

If you have questions about the rules, you can be post them here or to this user’s mailbox to be answered individually, if needed. I will add a FAQ to this post as I see the need.

Respuesta 4:
I have my own solo rules that give a win or lose game rather than beat your highest score.
Never tried joining a thread before so before I explain the rules I just want to check that this message works!

Respuesta 5:
My aim was to make the game as close to the actual rules as possible. The vast majority of the ‘rules’ below relate to how the Bot chooses and places tiles. I have tried to cover every eventuality but I suspect that this has led to the rules sounding more complicated than they really are!
Please note that I am not actually very good at Azul (losing on a regular basis to both of my son’s) so for the stronger players out there, I have suggested a couple of alterations at the end to make the Bot more competitive.

Human v ‘Bot’ Rules for Azul

Set up the table as normal for a two player game.

The Human plays the game exactly as they would in a real game.

The Bot also follows the usual rules (following the process given below) with three exceptions:
a) When playing more tiles than is needed to complete a pattern line, only the first extra tile drops to the ‘floor line’. Any others go into the box lid.
b) If the Bot takes the starting player marker it does NOT go on his floor line (but he will go first next round as normal).
c) In the scoring phase, each tile that the Bot moves to the wall scores an additional 2 points on top of the normal points scored.

The Bot starts the first round.

The word ‘shop’ used below signifies one of the six possible spaces that tiles may appear (the 5 factory displays plus the ‘centre’).

Factory Offer Stage for the Bot

The Bot randomly chooses a shop from amongst those that have tiles on them. (This could be 1, 2, 3, 4 or 5 shops.)

Once a shop is chosen, the Bot takes the tiles of the colour that has the most tiles in the shop. (If there is a tie for the most tiles of one colour, choose one of those colours at random.)
eg If there was 2 red, 1 blue and 1 black tile in the shop, the Bot would take the 2 red tiles (and, if the shop was one of the factory displays, the other tiles would go into the center as usual). If instead the shop chosen was the ‘center’ and there was 2 red, 2 blue, 2 black and 1 yellow tile, the Bot would choose at random between red, blue and black.
Exception: If the Bot is unable to place any of the chosen colour tiles on a pattern line, he ignores that colour and chooses between the other colours present in the shop (following the same rules). If none of the colours present in the shop will go on any pattern line then the Bot goes back to choosing the colour that has most tiles – placing one on the floor line and the others in the box lid. He does NOT choose a different shop.

Once the Bot has chosen his tile(s) he places them on a pattern line (following the normal placement rules) by choosing the highest possible option in the following list:

1) Complete exactly (ie no excess tiles) a part completed pattern line. (If two or more can be completed exactly, choose the lowest line.)
2) Complete exactly an empty pattern line.
3) Complete a part completed pattern line (putting the first excess tile on the floor line and any others in the box lid). If 2 or more pattern lines can be completed choose the one that requires most tiles. If there is still a choice, choose the lowest pattern line.
4) Complete an empty pattern line (putting the first excess tile on the floor line and any others in the box lid). If there is a choice, choose the lowest pattern line.
5) Place the tiles in a part completed pattern line. If two or more pattern lines can be added to, choose the one that needs the most tiles. If there is still a choice, choose the lowest pattern line.
6) Place the tiles in the lowest empty pattern line.
7) If no tile(s) can be placed on any pattern line, put the first one on the floor line and any others in the box lid.

Everything else is played according to the normal rules.
eg Game ends when one (or both) have a completed row. Whoever takes the starting player marker goes first in the next round. At the end of each round, the tiles in partly completed pattern lines stay on the board. Wall tiling phase is done in the usual way (except for the Bot’s 2 additional points for each tile that goes on the wall). End of game additional points are scored in the normal way. etc.


For a ‘harder’ Bot, change the rules so that he doesn’t put any excess tiles on the floor line. Or, give Bot 3 additional points (instead of 2) for each tile put on the wall. Or both options!


NB To randomly choose a shop I find it easier to put the factory displays in a straight line (and imagine the ‘centre’ to be at the end of the line) and simply use a normal 6 sided die. If there are 5 shops to choose from, ignore any throw of 6. If there are 4 shops to choose from, ignore any throw of 5 or 6. If there are 3 shops to choose from, a 1 or 2 gives 1st shop, a 3 or 4 gives 2nd shop, a 5 or 6 gives 3rd shop. If there are 2 shops to choose from, a 1, 2 or 3 gives 1st shop, a 4, 5 or 6 gives 2nd shop.

When needing to choose at random between 2 or more different colours, I simply put one of each colour in my hands, shake them up and pick one at random.

Thanks for posting this, your variant makes my brain feel VERY stretchy!

I’ve played 6 times (obsessively) this week but just can’t seem to win. I’ve pulled a few unlucky sets of tiles, but I feel like there’s more to it than that. I definitely focus on the action board with scoring secondary. Any tips/suggestions?

Also, at the end of the game, is it five points per board that has ANY empty tile rows or five points PER empty row?

Thanks!

Same! I’ve played a few times and keep getting “end game/loss”. I just wanna get through round seven and get an actual score!

Respuesta 10:
I keep losing!! Am I doing this right? You essentially have to complete round 7 without “ending the game immediately” to be able to get a score. I keep getting to Round 7 and adding the eighth tile to the penalty row . Learning curve here for sure.

Respuesta 11:
Joel, I came back to this after some time and I actually won! I think I was dropping tiles to the factory floor incorrectly and in a way that was MUCH harder. I have to play again with the change to make sure, but I would encourage you to double check how you’re playing if the overall experience is still enjoyable for you.

Tema 438: I love Azul
Pregunta:
Generally speaking all of my favourite games fall into the following not often used BGG category of games:

I can play it well with only my partner.

Given that this game falls into this category, I am naturally inclined to like it. But I don't think I'd bother posting here if that was all that was necessary to convey why I love Azul.

One of my favourite things about Azul is that sometimes it makes you feel absolutely awful. In the same way that you can see your dad or some other loved one going into a really long joke that's going to end with a terrible punchline - you see the slow motion disaster of a really horrible turn get bigger and bigger as it becomes inevitable you are going to lose half your points for the turn. It's a good feeling because it's a game and really it doesn't matter in the end but at the time you are totally invested and it's cool to experience bad things in safe environment. The real genius is that that awful feeling one gets is in part as a result of your own choices and contribution. If only you hadn't been trying to be such an ass for stealing the red your opponent wanted, you wouldn't be lumbered with six blues left and nowhere for you to place them.

One of my other favourite things about Azul is that it's really really simple. You don't have to be a genius to understand and comprehend the decisions you make in the game (this is distinguished from games with simple rules but complicated internal maths combos). This means two things: Firstly it means that almost anyone can play a decent game of Azul. But deliciously it means almost anyone can play a devious game of Azul! But even more deliciously (we're talking Heston Blumenthal level now) you can inflict a devious game of Azul on someone but because everyone can play deviously - it's not an unsatisfying deviousness (consider the absolute lack of feeling being an adult winning with a "fool's mate" against a child in the child's first game of chess). This level of competitiveness may be possible in other games, but I think there are very few where you can get this competitive and mean this quickly.

(I think the meanness feeling dilutes over larger player counts, so don't be too put off, you can also play nicely if you wish)

Another thing I like about Azul is the aesthetic. Prior to Azul I saw myself as a fairly utilitarian games player. Give me a cheaper price instead of fancy dan components I'd complain secretly to myself as I bought Potion Explosion. But Azul is so lovely that it's caused me to row back some of these opinions. I really like the feeling of grabbing a chunky fist of tiles from the bag (the utility bit of me argues that this does make it easier to count the tiles out the bag, but it is a half hearted argument, fully aware of the truth). I also really like the commitment to the square theme. A part of me moaned that the score tracks on each player board were a waste of space, but when you look at everything, the score track serves the square theme by making the player boards square. It's a really nice touch. The aesthetic choices go much further and subtler - I believe there is a post round here that describes why not all the tiles have patterns - but I am confident that my armchair graphic designer should really just shut up and let all the niceness sink in.

Anyway - I love Azul! It's great.

Respuesta 1:
I wanted to like Azul - But, lately the meaness from 2-player games with my husband happens more often than I'd like....Can be frustrating to witness one's own slaughter....

Respuesta 2:
I agree it's a great game. My experience with it, was that I played 3p the first 7-8 games, purely by coincidence. And now, having played it at 2p and 4p, I feel like the game:

1.) works really well at all player counts, but also
2.) changes more than most games that work well at different player counts. (i.e., when a game scales well, I feel like it typically feels similar at those various player counts)

I really hope it wins Spiel des Jahres. It checks so many boxes. It offers a gateway experience, as well as a veteran experience, it offers luck as well as strategy. I would say it offers solitaire or interactive, but sometimes the others at the table don't give you the choice

Great review, and go Azul!

Respuesta 3:
I love Azul too! A lovely game and I am a sucker for components.

I can highly recommend

Hive (Pocket, as it’s smaller, has a bag and a couple of expansion tiles included)

Confusion: espionage and deception in the Cold War

a secondhand (as it is no longer available) Rio Grande version of Knizia’s Samurai for the little black Bakelite-like pieces

any of the Gipf series of games (everyone has their favourite but Yinsh is highest rating, YMMV)

SixMaKing which is a wonderful concept W Eric Martin trumpeted loudly and rightly so.

Hope you don’t mind me singing some abstract praises



Tema 439: Review: Still fun after ten plays? My pros and cons
Pregunta:
Even though long extensive reviews seem to be the most popular reviews on BGG, I myself just don't have the time or the patience to read those.
I prefer quick overviews where I can get some insights into why this game may or may not be attractive to me.
My reviews are targeted at a similar audience, and just consist of my pros and cons coming from:
1) First impressions (before playing my first game)
2) Impressions after the first game
3) Current feelings (after at least 10 plays)

First impressions:
- It looked a bit too abstract for me and even more so for my wife, even though she was the one that bought this for me for christmas. I prefer more theme in my games.
+ The thick, heavy tiles look and feel great (including their bright colours; it’s definitly an eye catcher when on the table)
+ My wife was very proud for buying me a game that I had not requested already, that she thought would work very well for us (she did the research herself)

Impressions after the first game:
+ Ok, I was a bit surprised... I really enjoyed that! It felt like Splendor to me; also pretty much an abstract game, but it doesn’t feel too abstract. Easy to pick up, but plenty of depth without becoming too thinky and with great component quality.
+ The randomness of the tiles being drawn at the start of the round prevent anybody from being able to think many moves ahead, which is what avoids the fully abstract experience.
+ It may look a little like it’s mainly multiplayer solitaire, but it’s definitly not; you really want to pay attention to which stones your opponents need, and towards the end of each round you want to try to influence how many turns there will be before the round ends, so that you don’t end up with unwanted leftovers

Current feelings (10 plays into it):
+ It plays great at all player counts, and never felt too short or too long
+ This is fun for both casual players and more serious gamers; each can play at his own level. If you want, you can easily handicap some players by giving some players (new, young, more casual gamers,...) a number of points to start with, to make it challenging for every player.
+ I only played with the back side of the board once so far, but that adds another interesting decision to make for each tile you add to your mosaic; where to place it? (I only realized at the end that I had used the same set of four tiles spread over the same four columns in two different rows, making it impossible to finish both rows, as it would require the fifth colour in both rows in the last column, but you are not allowed to place the same colour twice in one column - you have to pay attention to avoid this!). This will further improve the longevity of the game.
+ There is a little bit of luck of the draw (I was shocked that not a single red tile was drawn in the last round of the last two player game I played, as I needed only one to finish putting the last red stone in my mosaic), but it’s a very small factor, and is more a positive thing here (more variety) than an annoyance (due to lack of control over the game outcome)

End conclusion (well, for now):
I think this has the potential to become a true classic, that generations will keep playing. I expect to play many more games of this. Definitly a keeper for us.
I do still prefer a game with more theme, though.

Watched only some online videos of full plays, but I found this game quite annoying because every single turn you have to do a lot of checks about victory points and all this need to be double-or-triple checked by your opponents in order to avoid mistakes, errors, cheating, ect

I prefer Sagrada where VP are calculated at the end once and for all, or games where the VP points advancing is more clear for all the players.

For these reasons (and others) I disagree and IMHO Azul doesn't have the numbers to become a classic such as e.g. Kingdomino.

Ah, well, I played with the front side of the board nine times first, so I was used to only putting one of each colour in a row, didn’t even come to mind to put a second one of the same colour in one row when we started using the other side of the board.

Yup. I do agree one could miscalculate (forgetting the -1 for instance), but we just count each player one by one at the end of each round, goes quite fast and avoids miscounts easily.

Respuesta 6:
Nice review, Olaf - -

I appreciate your observation that Azul feels less abstract due to not being able to completely plan ahead. And I like your handicap idea ... even a few points would make a difference in this low-scoring game.

Theme ... using pretty ceramic tiles to create designs (as they did in Portugal long ago) strikes me as a little strange and not an Important (world-changing) Project. But just being attractive-looking is nice for both the real-life mosaics and for the game; not a terrible "theme" even if not a real deep one, and good enough for me.

I agree with your prediction that Azul will be around for a long time. Already around #40 on BGG ... WOW!

For these reasons (and others) I disagree and IMHO Azul doesn't have the numbers to become a classic such as e.g. Kingdomino.
Don’t like calculating scores 5 or 6 times in-game? You just crossed out a TON of games.

You are not allowed having the same color twice in a column or a row, no matter what side of the board you play. Think of it as Sudoku with colors

There is a little bit of luck of the draw (I was shocked that not a single red tile was drawn in the last round of the last two player game I played, as I needed only one to finish putting the last red stone in my mosaic), but it’s a very small factor, and is more a positive thing here (more variety) than an annoyance (due to lack of control over the game outcome)
While I agree that there is a bit of randomness amongst the tile draw, especially for the last few rounds it becomes more and more predictable what will be drawn.
All placed tiles are on the player boards, and all discarded tiles (if played by the rules) will sit in the box lid. You are able to count how many tiles of each color are already in play/discarded and how many are still in the bag.

David, I do like calculating while playing when:

a) it's an immediate thing and not too complicated (e.g. Terraforming Rate in Terraforming Mars, Victory Points in Viticulture)
b) doesn't break game flow
c) I don't have to check how well the opponent calculates

Technically in a two player game, most of the time that final pull is perfect information, only time it won't be is if you have allowed the game to go longer than 5 rounds, which does happen from time to time. All the discarded tiles are outside the bag during that pull and you won't put them back in until after you empty the bag, which won't be until you have to fill for that possible 6th round due to have 20 tiles left in the bag at the start of round 5.

While I know the distinction between tactical and strategic decisions, I've never understood how a game can't be both, ie. a tactical strategy game. I've seen a discussion like this come up in connection to Carcassonne as well a few times in the past.
All games are both tactical and strategic to some degree if they're not trivial. And even with trival games (say  ) you can you can have a tactic ("I'm going to go with rock this turn") and a strategy ("My opponent appears to like scissors, so I will favor rock").

When we say a game is highly tactical, what we really mean is that the tactical decisions you make in the game ("what's my best move at this very moment") will tend to dominate in determining whether you win or lose. When we say a game is highly strategic, we mean that your overall plan (the blueprint for how you intend to secure victory and outwit your opponents) dominates in determining whether you win or lose.

Yes, the initial layout of Azul offers some strategic value, but Azul is won or lost not because a player had a clever plan of action but because the player best optimized his individual choices. And yes, it is possible to strategize (noticing a particular color is going to be scarce or abundant for example) but those aren't the dominant decisions in the game...the game is won or lost by taking the best individual actions and offering your opponents poor ones. In the first round of Azul, you typically do not worry to a great degree what's going to happen in the fifth round...there's too much you don't know yet.

The same is true with  . There is certainly strategy involved in the sense that farmers are a long-term plan and need to be set up in advance, but a good deal of the game's determining factors are embodied in the proper choices each player takes to maximize points earned on each turn. It's nearly impossible to have a plan for what you're going to do with your farmers when you start a game of Carcassonne. You have to wait to see what happens.

Pete (offers, by contrast, a game like Dominion, in which a great deal of your success or failure is determined before the very first action by the plan you intend to implement)

Respuesta 22:
I do agree with some of pete’s Points

He is right though, nothing stops a game from being both tactical and strategic.

First let’s look at what the purpose of a strategy is:
A strategy (according to the dictionary) when applying to the military, which I think applies in a game because you are going against an opposing player or even the game itself, is intended to render the enemy incapable of making war, as by the destruction of materials, factories, etc.

A tactic (once again according to the dictionary) is characterized by skillful tactics or adroit maneuvering or procedure; of or relating to a maneuver or plan of action designed as an expedient toward gaining a desired end or temporary advantage.

To my understanding, I take this to mean that strategy is about what you can do to someone else (interactive), and tactic applies to your awareness and ability within the situation to execute on a plan (solitaire)

Strategy is a long term game plan having to do with interaction, a tactic is a short term plan that is all about you.

Example applying to Azul: I have the strategy of focusing strictly on filling out as many columns as I can on my board and making sure I can get 5 red tiles first before Pete (my plan directly interacts with Pete) to go on my grid for the point bonus end game.

Tactics having to do with how I carry out my strategy is watching how pete’s Own strategy affects mine and then reacting to it and executing moves that will fulfill my plan (this part is all about me and my ability to do this), for example, if I see Pete starting to take the red tiles during the rounds, I need to make sure that during my turns I maximize on my opportunities to take as many of those tiles as possible

Born out of the mechanisms of Azul in taking tiles comes in the strategy which would be to essentially block Pete to keep him from taking my tiles. Azul’s tile drafting mechanism which is the core of the game forces interaction, because of this strategy is necessary and even forced, unlike an engine building game where it’s mainly tactical in that it’s all about me making my engine run the best possible way to score points (solitaire) and others choices do not affect my plan very much.

Now going back to my imaginary Azul game with Pete,
How would I go about my strategy to block Pete? Well, I would Make it so that when I take tiles, I either take the red ones first, or if I’ve noticed that Pete doesn’t need a certain color and it would end up giving him minus points at the end of the round, I would tactically make moves that make it so the reds would bunch up with those colors he didn’t need (of course setting up as many good tiles for myself within that) and so to him going for those reds would not be so tempting.

So here you see that both strategy and tactics are applied almost to the point where there’s no difference. In some games I think that one will Stand out more over the other (like in the above example, engine building games being more tactical) but in Azul they both seem to go hand in hand.

But I believe that Azul is more strategic than tactical. And this being due to its tile drafting and scoring mechanisms

I’ve already talked about the tile drafting mechanism being interactive.
Now let’s talk about the scoring mechanisms.
In Azul, I have all the information from the beginning. I know how many tiles there are, I know what the distribution of colors is. I know how many I need to score, when and where I need them to move over to score points. That is the key. Even though I don’t know what tiles will be where when they comes out of the bag, I know in what order I need to be picking them up to maximize my scoring at the end of the round.

If I know the blue tile will be sliding over and score me 1 point, then after that’s been set I can make it so the line beneath my blues (let’s say it’s red tiles) will be filled so after that blue tile scores me 1 point, when I go to my red row and the tile slides over that tile will now score 2 points because it is next to my blue. This mechanism, though simple, is all the strategy in the game.

The reason I say that I believe Azul is more strategic is because From the beginning I have a full understanding of the entire board state and where that board state could go. The fact that all information is open means I know what tiles Pete needs and what tiles he doesn’t. This establishes strategy at the forefront because Azul forces interactivity by the way tiles are placed and moved around. My choices will directly affect Pete.

The scoring mechanism is all strategy, because like I mentioned I have full information of what’s on the table to be drafted and what things I myself need and so I plan to get tiles in a certain order to maximize my scoring opportunities.

The tactical part has to do with the randomization of tiles. What tiles comes out of the bag and what tiles get placed where. But this bag drawing mechanism is not the main part of the game. The drafting and scoring are the main part.

And example of a highly tactical game, would be BLood rage, why? Because since there are random card draws and Hidden information concerning what cards players have in their possessions, tactics take the primary role in scoring because lack of information focuses me on my own hand of cards than my opponents. So my turns are all about reacting, and I can have a strategy but someone else’s choice during the game might crush my strategy so it becomes about my ability or outmaneuver my opponents instead of how I can directly affect them so I can score points, so I need to outmaneuver the other players so that I may score points.

Now all of that might be a little confusing, it makes sense to me though.

But in my opinion, Azul is more strategic than tactical although tactics are important in the game. And also I believe that the tactical part increases at its highest player count which is 4 player, but at 2 and 3 it is at its most strategic.

And my strategy to outmaneuver Pete by writing up a longer post than him succeeded.

Tactical usually refers to turn to turn choices, and strategic is decision making towards an endgame.

I'm not sure how people are playing Azul but when I'm playing, I focus my strategic play on a corner and use that plan to guide my tactical drafting decisions.

Tema 443: Azul vs Sagrada - (my first) multi-game review
Pregunta:
I've seen enough comparisons between Azul & Sagrada, that I figured it's about time that someone actually flesh out their thoughts to dispel the notion that these games are anything alike...



Let me first set the stage. I've played each of these games at least 5 times, and I do not particularly enjoy Sagrada. It’s not that it’s a bad game, it just doesn’t grab me. I also have not yet played every difficulty level in Sagrada, or Azul’s b-side.



Now I won't delve in to the rules in this review, but instead just offer my thoughts. Starting with the obvious... Azul is a tile-laying game, whereas Sagrada is a dice game. Both are family-oriented games that are quick to teach & easy to play. - And while both are puzzle-like, I think that's about the only comparison.



Azul is better for a smaller number of people. In fact, the smaller the number, the more cut-throat it becomes. While that is an aspect not everyone appreciates in a game, I for one do. Getting that 1 point for example just doesn’t seem as sweet, if you can cause your opponent to lose 5+.

Since I’m talking about the game’s appeal, I’ll mention too that while I understand that the box may not appeal to everyone, having recently visited the Iberian peninsula & seen for myself the significance of tiles in royal palaces, I appreciate the theme all the more...

While I do believe this game is friendly to those with various color vision deficiencies (or “blindness”, if you’d rather), they could have gone one step further & designed the game such that all tiles in the game featured a pattern.

All that said though, the key point I’d like to make though is that Azul scores like  , and therefore I have no idea why people do not gravitate to that comparison instead.



As for Sagrada, it plays a higher player count & the actions are quick enough that there’s not a lot of downtime - even at a higher player count. It also introduces variability with both scoring cards, and cards that allow you bend the rules. Variability equals longevity, so in that aspect you're likely to get your $$ out of a game like this & that is something that deserves recognition!

Now the puzzle cards leave me, well puzzled. They have different difficulties, but I found that in my limited play it didn't matter much. 3* difficulty or 5*, either way, I typically ended up with a single hole in my window.

Now you can't compare the dice in this game to the beautiful tiles of Azul... In fact, I noted an extra pip drilled into the corner of a die from the game I played most recently - something I had never seen before, which speaks to the production quality. Regardless, I want to draw attention again to those with color vision deficiencies, that this might not be a game for you. If the dice are not a problem, differentiating the colors on your game board certainly will be!



If it seems like I have more favorable things to say about Sagrada, then why doesn't it grab me? It just might be that I prefer games that I feel like I am in control of (even if that's just an illusion)… I like playing games, but I do not like when games play me. I think that might be why Sagrada doesn’t appeal to me – particularly with the more complex puzzle cards. Sometimes it’s all too obvious what action you should take & so at that point, I find myself asking why am I “playing” this again?



In closing, I also often see people ask if I can only purchase one, which one would it be? Well, they are different enough that you could buy both!! ... but not me. I'm happy enough with my copy of Azul.

Respuesta 1:
I find them much more similar than you suggest, for the following reasons.

1. both really are tile-laying games. there are 5 different tile colors in azul, and 5 different "tile" (dice) colors of 6 possible different values in sagrada. so similar except that sagrada dice/tiles have a second degree of variability. in both you score according to how well you played the different tiles on your own board.

i do not consider sagrada to be a "dice rolling game" because other than for your secret goal color, the value of each die face might as well be an abstract symbol. if the dice turn up with bigger numbers, you don't get to do more with them.

in both games, you have a randomized assortment of choices, for playing in your private board, in a drafting phase; azul just adds the score up as you go along, whereas sagrada calculates the scores only when the game is over.

2. both are "multi-player solitaire" games. each player is basically trying to figure out which "tiles" to take for their own personal board, and where to fit them in for the best possible play, which also considering whether the "hate draft" and take ones that are not as good for themselves, just to keep their opponents from getting something *they* really want.

as is standard for multi-player solitaire, hate drafting is the main form of player interaction. they each have one other player interaction mechanic - in sagrada, the first player to use a tool raises the cost to use it thereafter, and in azul, a player can seize control of the turn order by taking the first player tile (for a small penalty).

3. i don't know why you say sagrada plays a higher player count; both games play up to 4P. (azul 2-4, sagrada 1-4)

4. i can and do find the dice in sagrada to be prettier than the tiles in azul. but that's a matter of personal preference, and no fault in your part if you prefer the azul tiles. in both cases the components are wonderfully tied to the theme of what is really an abstract game with a theme pasted on. but the sagrada boards are much better at supporting the illusion that you are actually working on a stained glass wondow; in azul, it never feels like you're working on an actual wall.

5. i think that the score tracks for both games suck. azul has you just use a cube to mark a place on a long number line on your own board; bump it accidentally and you lose your score. sagrada uses tiny markers on a tiny board, but at least you don't add up the score until the end, so you cannot really mess it up mid-game.

6. agree that sagrada has more degrees of flexibility: random tool card selection, random common goals selection, and every player plays on a different board.

7. disagree about the difficulty levels of sagrada boards. the 3-boards are MUCH easier to play than the 6-boards.

8. agree that while azul could be better for color blind players, sagrada is basically unplayable if you have a color vision deficiency.

9. multi-player solitaire games always become player-vs-player at 2P, because everything that hurts your opponent helps you by exactly that amount. in contrast, with 3-4P, hurting one opponent gains you nothing over the others, so you're almost always better off in 3-4P just maximizing your own score.

i am curious how people think these compare to two other multi-player solitaire games, splendor (2-4P, a game which i have come to dread playing with other people because it drags so much) and minerva (1-4P, much more complex, which has a pass/pay player interaction mechanic).

thank you for the review.

Respuesta 2:
In terms of my statement about the player count, it was my intention to simply say that between the two, you're better off choosing Sagrada if you have a higher player count.

Otherwise, some good points, for sure... especially with regards to the score tracks. Because you tally your points at the end, you are less likely to screw up the scoreboard with Sagrada. - Yet another reason why I could not argue with anyone who believes Sagrada is the better game.


Now I have since played Azul's b-side, and I have to add that I prefer the dynamic freedom it offers. You still have to play by the same rules, but it gives you the illusion of more choice!

After screwing myself the first couple of times, I quickly realized the best way to play the b-side, is to play the diagonal. You can only play 5 tiles of each color, and so if you play them such that the sum of the spaces always equals 5 on the 1-2 diagonal lines you've committed for playing that tile type, you can avoid placement problems.

A game like played that will probably produce lower scores early on if you play the long game. If you assemble tight clusters for higher scores and play the short game, you probably stand a good chance of winning. As always, it's important to pay attention to how other players are playing...

Maybe they could sell them thru the GeekStore. It would cut down on Next Move's logistics, the Geekstore is used to handling small things and small numbers of small things.
There is obviously still a lot of demand for the tile. I hope they decide to do another print run. It was a really nice gesture to do it at all, but the botched execution leaves a bad taste that can nevertheless be easily fixed with a 2nd print run. People are willing to pay for it. Please let us give you our money.

Tema 446: First player
Pregunta:
Marginally confused by why the rules specify that the 1st player puts their marker tile onto the floor only when selecting tiles from the middle of the factories.

Since players have to keep drafting tiles until the tiles run out, this would seem to mean that this tile is almost guaranteed to end up on the floor. There would have to be a pretty freakish distribution of tiles for the 1st player to even have the opportunity to never have to draft from that middle pile, let alone want to do so.

I get that putting it on the floor is a nice balance for the advantage of going first. But I just don't quite get that the rules take the trouble of adding complexity based on drafting rather than just saying "the 1st player takes the maker and puts it on their floor".

It makes me think I'm missing something?

Respuesta 1:
Just to clarify

The 1st player to take tiles from the central pile takes the first player marker and puts it on their tile floor. They then become the start player for the next round.

Respuesta 2:
Yeah, it's when you claim the first player marker for the *next* round that it goes on your floor.

Respuesta 3:
The rule reads:

If you are the first player in this round to pick tiles from the center of the table, also take the starting player marker and place it onto the leftmost free space of your floor line.

As others have said above, it's just saying if you're the first to grab from the center, you take the 1st player token and drop it onto your floor line.

Thanks for the clarification - I understand now.

You miss one point:

There is a 1:1 chance, that the starting player marker is placed in the center in the first turn of a round.

And the rules state: Phase A ends if all factories AND the center are empty.

Consequently someone will have to take the starting player marker from the center otherwise the phase A of that round will never end.

But the rules say that on your turn you have to pick "all tiles of the same color" from a factory or the center.

And it's pretty clear that "all tiles" is meant to mean a positive number of tiles of a given color (otherwise players could pick "all tiles" of a non-present color, effectively passing).

So in this (extremely improbable) situation where only the first player tile remains, it seems a player has no legal move. (And thus would not take the first player tile.)

Really? They've said the new tiles are not intended to replace the blank tiles, but are usable with the back side of the board and can even be used WITH the original blank tiles.

Respuesta 7:
I don't feel the need to defend often, but there are valid criticism in your ranting, but they are overshadowed by some very angry rhetoric

1) First player token: Yes, not managed properly in my opinion, in and outside of the US. However, really inconsequential to the game. It seems as though the company started to produce enough of the game (thanks to demand) that they could afford a "custom" first player token that really comes down to 1 tile a game. A white tile with print on it, none the less, not like an already manufactured colored tile. Again, inconsequential to the play of the game.
2) "Blank" tiles: The non printed tiles are done by design. Someone that works there (designer? publisher?) already commented in another thread that basically the artist drew/colored it that way because the game could easily look too busy without some more subtle blank tiles included. The fact that a teal/orangeish tile was released had more to do with the new company that bought them and their logo colors than trying to replace the already existing non printed blue/red tiles. Just happens to match well enough. Would it still bother you if the promo tiles were Purple and Yellow? Forest Green? Some color you like but cannot be easily interpreted as replacing the blue/red included in the game?
3) Joker Tiles: I can't comment on distribution outside of the US, and it seems like Plan B/Next Move is not the only offender, but I agree international distribution could be better. And availability of these type of promo tiles would have been better if they were in sync, and more readily available, or a lot more clear that they are "first come first serve limited printing, might not have them in a month" type things.
4) Golem edition: There are a ton of threads on this. I think they put themselves in an unwinnable predicament. Fact is (seemingly) they did not predict that the Golem edition would be as heavily demanded as it was. It was a neat thought experiment come to fruition. The market does really well with middle eastern themed trading games. Maybe they should have done more research on whether that market is oversaturated, or maybe they did and came to the conclusion that they could still fit a role with their game. Either way their intention has always been a Century Trilogy. To help promote the first game, they made a special edition available at a show and online and it sold like hot cakes. People fervorously debated whether the risk of not being able to include it in the planned integratable games is worth the artwork/components that appealed to them more. I'm sure someone in their small marketing/business department went to the designers/owners and said "we can't ignore how much money we can make if we sell this at a wider distribution, and maybe even make sequels" And the damage had already been done. No matter what they do they are looked at as either going back on their "promises" or being looked at as "unfair" for not making enough to meet demand.

Fact is, the company wouldn't last long if they went by what seemed like better ideas in hindsight. They probably would have to increase the cost of Azul if it immediately came with a resin first player token due to manufacturing costs of their initial release numbers, or they'd have to risk releasing more than possible demand and possibly lose money. If they outright said Golem is an equivalent series that will be developed along side Century they'd eat into their own profits. If they made it a wide distribution they'd be going against what their marketing team suggested with the middle eastern theme and taking a big gamble. If they stuck to their guns and said "we aren't making more" or "distributing them to stores" then they would just look foolish and not make easy money that they can then throw at different ventures. If they pushed a wider release internationally they are gambling a market that just generally seems to not do as well as an american market (is my assumption, otherwise there would be more companies that distribute internationally if there was the demand there to overcome the costs)

etc. etc. etc.

Flawed, yes. Imperfect, definitely. Deserving failure though? For trying what seems to be their hardest given the information they have? That seems a bit cruel.

All of this done with the assumption that Plan B games, which as published 4 games (Azul, Century: Spice Road, Century: Golem and Century: Eastern Wonders) and their purchaser Next Move games, which has published 2 games (Azul and Reef) are fairly small companies compared to maybe Z-man or even Plaid-hat.

Respuesta 8:
Venting a bit...?

1) They sold a few of the new first player markers on their own webshop, the remaining stock went out to distributors/game stores, so maybe ask your FLGS to get some?

2) "half the art"? there are blank tiles and pattern tiles, and layed out on the printed (default) side of the game board, it looks great, and it does not harm gameplay in any way. the collector's tiles are for people who want to bling out their games, not make it playable.

3) premium promo items, alot of games have those ... go to any bigger boardgame convention and grab a bunch.

Now it might be just me, but I hope this company won't last long...
1. All games have production costs. We had space on a punchboard and went with it. Personally I like the extra embellishments found on the cardboard tile.

Related - we didn't have to create thousands of extra first player tiles. We did so as a kindness. A response to fan suggestion. Costs ran from $3-5 USD to ship them.

Staff involved on both decisions will not result in being fired.

2. The tiles were intentionally left blank. I questioned our art team, simply put its a place to rest your eyes from an otherwise busy board.

The collector tiles were never marketed as replacements for the solid blue and red. Instead the colors were selected to match Next Move Games (our abstract line) color scheme (real and orange)

3. Jokers are a web exclusive item, our german partner Pegasus was selling these online. We are exploring options to ship within Europe to help offset time and cost. One step ahead of you

We can't make promises of stock for Essen as it's 5 months away. We will place an order soon for the show though.

Century - it's a long history. Introduced as a game with two themes years before release. When it came time to sell it, distributors and partners weren't on board. We knew there was interest and printed it for direct consumer fulfillment. Since then distributors and fans have rejoiced and it went to retail.


Right now the team is deciding if we should pursue Golem sequels. No word yet, butni will share when I do.

All the while we are a small shop. Experienced and eager to craft great games. We learn from things to improve. I hope you are willing to give us a chance. We have great games coming down the line.

Despite wishing failure on us, I wish the best for you. I appreciate your candidness, but hope my response has lent some light for you to see our perspective. Be well.

3. Jokers available only on their website, ok I can live with that, but can we find a way to actually give a f**k about non-us gamers?
Like I dunno make sure you have stock for essen? I know last year it was available but this year no one promise it will...

Moving on from Azul, century spice road... Maybe it is just me, but what is the idea with 2 themes for one game?! while only making one part of a trilogy (the one less people love actually).

Now it might be just me, but I hope this company won't last long...
1. All games have production costs. We had space on a punchboard and went with it. Personally I like the extra embellishments found on the cardboard tile.

Related - we didn't have to create thousands of extra first player tiles. We did so as a kindness. A response to fan suggestion. Costs ran from $3-5 USD to ship them.

Staff involved on both decisions will not result in being fired.

2. The tiles were intentionally left blank. I questioned our art team, simply put its a place to rest your eyes from an otherwise busy board.

The collector tiles were never marketed as replacements for the solid blue and red. Instead the colors were selected to match Next Move Games (our abstract line) color scheme (real and orange)

3. Jokers are a web exclusive item, our german partner Pegasus was selling these online. We are exploring options to ship within Europe to help offset time and cost. One step ahead of you

We can't make promises of stock for Essen as it's 5 months away. We will place an order soon for the show though.

Century - it's a long history. Introduced as a game with two themes years before release. When it came time to sell it, distributors and partners weren't on board. We knew there was interest and printed it for direct consumer fulfillment. Since then distributors and fans have rejoiced and it went to retail.


Right now the team is deciding if we should pursue Golem sequels. No word yet, butni will share when I do.

All the while we are a small shop. Experienced and eager to craft great games. We learn from things to improve. I hope you are willing to give us a chance. We have great games coming down the line.

Despite wishing failure on us, I wish the best for you. I appreciate your candidness, but hope my response has lent some light for you to see our perspective. Be well.
Now THAT was a masterclass on how to message for a company.

Oh man. I think the OP totally missed the point on this. Take my grievance for example:

I have the second print run of the game and the insert is COMPLETELY USELESS. There's a spot in it for the cardboard 1st player marker that was only available to people who purchased the first run. It serves no purpose to me whatsoever but is a constant reminder that I'm missing out on something that early adopters received.

As far as I know, the publisher is not providing those cardboard tokens anywhere so I'll never be able to "complete" my game. I now hesitate to toss out the insert entirely as it serves such little purpose to me as is.

The question has been understood and answered but there is potential confusion for readers who see the term "round". A "round" consists of 3 phases, and each round has 3 phases

The game is played over multiple rounds, each of which is
composed of three phases:
A. Factory offer
B. Wall-tiling
C. Preparing the next round


and the question was really about how the first "phase" ended.

Azul is still easier to learn than chess. In chess, you have to learn movement patterns for six different types of pieces. And one of those pieces, the pawn, has a movement pattern different than its capture pattern. The pawn also has a different move available on its first move. Then you have the whole en passant thing which is difficult to grasp. On top of all this you must learn about check and checkmate, plus castling and the conditions which must be met to castle. Then even more, there are rules about forced draws and stalemate. Sure, you may be able to condense all this to a few paragraphs. But those paragraphs are quite dense and is significantly harder to absorb than the rules for Azul.

It definitly is. We Played it with my two kids (8 and 10 years) and they wanted to play it again although they lost the game. The game is easy to learn and they can work out strategies very easy and proof the funcionality very directly. So it's not only the simple rules but also the chance for the kids to get a good learning experience.
And by the way you can bring them in contact with a cultural and artistic peculiarity if you tell them about the history of the original azulejos.
But i have to admit, that my kids have been sort of socialized with boardgames more then others (of their classmates) so they get a better grip on games and strategies in general.



Tema 451: Score Attack Solo Variant
Pregunta:
Here is my attempt at a solo score attack variant:

Setup
Setup a two player A side game, except put the factory displays in a line and replace the center of the table with a location below the line of displays. Each of the five displays will be referenced by indicies 1 through 5 going left to right.

Gameplay
Play your turns as normal. For AI player turns, draw a tile from the bag. Refer to the top row of the color mat to determine what display index the drawn tile type indicates (e.g. solid blue is index 1). Draw a second tile to indicate what tile type the AI player will take. If the drawn tile type is not present in the displays or "center" then increment the tile type to the next tile type that is present, using the top row of the color mat, going left to right and wrapping if necessary. Starting at the drawn display, look for the chosen tile type, increasing the display index if the tile type is not found. After display 5, go to the "center", and if the tile is not present there, then wrap around to display 1. The AI player will take all of the tiles of the chosen type from the location like a player, but will add the tiles directly to the mat in the matching color location going top to bottom. Tiles in excess of 5 of a color for the AI player will go right into the box lid. The AI player does not score. The drawn AI selection tiles go in the box lid after the AI turn.

Other rule changes
A new game end trigger condition will be the AI mat being filled completely. Complete the round and then the game ends. The game also ends the round the human player completes a row as usual.

The 1st player tile functions as normal with the first player to take from the center in a round taking the tile and going first the subsequent round.

Players earn 2 additional points per empty tile on the AI player mat at the end of the game.

Respuesta 1:
This looks interesting. I will try it out.

Respuesta 2:
Thanks for this, it's great! One question: What should you do when none of the rival's drawn tile type is left on the board? redraw?

Respuesta 3:
Look at the top row of the player board staring with the drawn tile type and keep going to the left (then wrapping back around) until you encounter a tile type that is available.



Tema 452: -14 points for getting the last tiles in a round?
Pregunta:
Is it really by design that turn order can cause you to draw last, and get stuck with -14 points due to being forced to take 9 blue tiles and having nowhere to put them.

This happened in round 3, causing my score to be embarrassing. This wasn't so much a penalty for bad planning, but a huge random penatly for no reason. To make matters worse, the person two turns earlier was put in a kingmaking situation with two possible victims, since it was deterministic who would get the pile of tiles and not have anywhere to put them.

Maybe this was my fault, but one hell of a poor experience for my first try of this top 50 game. Wow.

thanks in advance for clarifying if we got the rules right...
---tom

Respuesta 1:
It's not a "random penalty". What tiles are available in a round are known at the outset, the trick to playing Azul is to manipulate the tiles available in such a way that you maximize your own scoring opportunities while minimizing those of other players.

The player who took the tiles just ahead of you played better since as the pool shrinks the choices become fewer and fewer. If you had seen that none of the others were too keen on those blue tiles you should have taken some of them before they grew to nine.

(Also, the term "kingmaking" should only apply where a player help another player in a way that would be a non-optimal play for themselves, affecting other players is part and parcel of any interactive game.)

Respuesta 2:
It's possible yes, and I've even been hit with this and still scored over 70 points at the end of the game.

Planning is important to keep this from happening. Sometimes you have to take what you need to take to prevent this kind of thing from happening instead of what you really want to take.

Letting that many tiles build up in the middle is rare as you play it more times. If I start to see a pile building up, and my 4 or 5 row is empty, I'll grab what's maybe 6 or 7 tiles and put them in one of those rows and take the small hit of points instead of possibly being left taking the entire pile with no place for them and eating a massive penalty.

Keep playing!

I'll agree with the crowd. This wasn't a "random penalty" it was "playing poorly".

Respuesta 12:
If you let 9 tiles pile up in the middle someone is going to eat a load of shit, your job then is to make sure it's not you. Alternately don't put quite so big of a loaded gun in the middle of the table if you don't think you can manipulate the draws to where you don't eat it.

Respuesta 13:
Before there were 9 blue tiles in the middle there must have been about only 5 at one point. Why did nobody take those to complete their last row? In my plays it is rather rare that one color piles up to 5 tiles. I would also not be afraid to take the first player marker, since going first in the next round outweighs the point penalty most of the time.

Respuesta 14:
My very first game: Took a -12 point hit in the next to last round, still only lost by 2 points at the end. Keep on playing, it's not multiplayer solitaire, as someone earlier suggested.

Respuesta 15:
I think the group is too harsh here. Without seeing details about your game, I do not know if you could reasonably have played differently to work towards victory without risking a likely -14. I hope you don't give up on the title and maybe you'll figure out how to give that horrible friend of yours -14.

Respuesta 16:
I agree that if this was random, it would be really bad. But let me chime in with the others: it was NOT random, it happened because what you did before the situation arose.

If you're last to draw, then it's because the guy to your left took the start player marker last round, and it was you who let him take it instead of taking it yourself.

If there are a lot of a tile type you don't want in the middle, then it's because you didn't take some of them before they accumulated, and likely you pushed some of them into the middle yourself when you took something else from a factory.

And doing your second-to-last (or even third-to-last) move should already consider such risks - maybe emptying that last factory isn't such a great idea if it leaves exactly four types of tiles in the middle (assuming 4p), with the other players able and interested to leave a heap a tiles you don't want to you.

This being said, there are sometimes situations where you have no chance to avoid taking a lot of minus points, if only because other players don't play as you expected (which may be due to them playing really strange, or because your prediction skills aren't up to the task yet ). It just happens - just make sure it happens to your opponents more often (or as least as often ) as it does to you.

Respuesta 17:
Got stuck with -14 in the first round of my first game (was still trying to figure out what I was doing). Fortunately it turns out that you can't go negartive and that your points simply regress to 0 (I only made three points in that first round so it was no big loss).

Later on, after a few more runs, I started to see the potential of purposely dumping a whole lot of one colour on an opponent. It becomes a worthwhile strategic part of the game (also finding ways of avoiding being the person being stuck with a whole lot of unusable tiles).

Respuesta 18:
i have seen several instances where this happened to one player where there is literally nothing they could have done to prevent this (in one case, it was mostly because of poor play in an earlier round, but being stuck with a massive -14 point penalty twice in a row and not being able to prevent it feels like it shouldn't happen. and there was NOTHING she could have done to prevent it.)

i just house-ruled it that if you want, you can trash the entire draw instead of keeping any of it. you don't get penalized, but you also don't get any points from doing this, so it's still bad.

Tema 454: I'm not in the hype train.
Pregunta:
I can only speak of Azul as a two player game - this is the only way I played it, and how I usually play all other games.

After a coupe of reviews and recommendations I knew I had to play it. Players are in awe of this game, it showed up in many "best games ..." lists, I haven't seen a negative review. It's a new "classic game for everyone's collection" to stand between 7 wonders and Carcassonne.

I'm ok with that. After several (2 player only) games I see that it's a generally good game, with beautiful components, easy enough to teach in 5 minutes and deep enough for cutthroat duels. But still, I'm not a fan.

First of all, a couple of opinions I strongly disagree with:

* "Rules are simple and the rulebook clarifies everything, so you can easily teach the game" - I wish it was like that. Unfortunately bgg forums and even reviewers show me that not everything is simple from the start. For a game of this popularity and simplicity the rules should be crystal clear, with many examples and commonly made mistakes explained.

* "Looks enhance the already great game experience" - the main point of many reviews is how well done Azul's components are (apart from the 1st player token). And many discussions about the game and general impressions about it come from the visual aspect. Sure, it's important for a game to appeal to your aesthetics, but it's not a main aspect for me. The game is good, but beneath the surface there's a simple tile drafting and placing mechanic that you can play a finite number of times. With lesser quality of components I don't think it would be a star or widely noticed and appreciated.

What bothers me most about Azul is thus the price range. In Poland you can buy it for about 30€ right now. Similar to Terraforming Mars, Ticket to Ride, Smallworld, 7 wonders, heck, even Talisman, generally "larger", games. Whilst the mechanics and what the game has to offer is for me closer to Patchwork range of 12€, not to mention classic abstract games.

This is similar for me to Sagrada and Santorini. Both games are simple in the mechanics side with a nice wrapping, but I have less against their component as they contribute to game experience heavily:
- Sagrada's dice are colorful for a reason to tell them apart in two categories (other being a die value),
- Santorini's floors enable a clear visual representation of the board state, otherwise hard to achieve.

In Azul, the tiles could be replaced by almost anything without impacting the mechanics, beautiful boards and tiles apart from looking really nice, add nothing to the core aspect of draft and place.

My conclusion is: it was the visuals which took an otherwise decent game to the point it became popular and most wanted. Seeing beyond it's looks we get a "still fun but nothing extraordinary" game.

I give a bgg score of 7, good, usually willing to play. But I wouldn't recommend it too much, as in the same value you can get a more interesting game, or two.

It's a nice game, but not a keeper IMHO. One particular thing bothered me about the game: the individual player board. I like my abstract games to have a common battleground for all the players (some of my favorites: Onitama, Hive, Rosenkonig, TZAAR, The Duke, Taluva). I felt a little odd arranging things in my own board, it felt a bit MPS to me (and I hate MPS).
I don't think it should feel MPS. If you're playing to win, Azul is almost as much about playing against your opponents as it is for yourself. I'm analyzing their board almost as much as my own, especially later in the game.

A little, but if players are paying attention to what other players need, it starts to really inform your own choices - you can really set players back by setting up large amounts of a color and foisting those stockpiles on a player that doesn't want them.

What bothers me most about Azul is thus the price range. In Poland you can buy it for about 30€ right now. Similar to Terraforming Mars, Ticket to Ride, Smallworld, 7 wonders, heck, even Talisman, generally "larger", games. Whilst the mechanics and what the game has to offer is for me closer to Patchwork range of 12€, not to mention classic abstract games.
That's unfortunate. In the US the price is somewhat-to-significantly lower than the other games you mentioned. It's still not as cheap as Patchwork, but it's in between Patchwork and the others.

This is similar for me to Sagrada and Santorini. Both games are simple in the mechanics side with a nice wrapping, but I have less against their component as they contribute to game experience heavily:
- Sagrada's dice are colorful for a reason to tell them apart in two categories (other being a die value),
- Santorini's floors enable a clear visual representation of the board state, otherwise hard to achieve.
Azul's tiles are colorful to tell them apart quickly at a glance on drafting tiles, on your board, and on other players' boards. I don't think they're unnecessarily extravagant.

I never said I played it as a MPS game. I said it felt like one.

I know you’re supposed to constantly check your opponents’ boards at all times. But once you did that and selected your handful of tiles, it’s spreadsheet optimization time in your own small world. That part felt MPS to me.

There is one place where the rule book screwed up. It’s in the section that explains the variant side of the board. It states specifically that you cannot repeat a color in a vertical column, but says nothing about repeating a color in a row. It does say, before the alluded to statement, that the game is otherwise played by the normal rules. Does that naturally mean you cannot repeat a color in a row? Well, not repeating a color in a column was also part of the normal base game. It is therefore unclear whether the variant board allows colors to repeat in a row and I have seen opinions both ways. The rules, if they specifically mention vertical columns, should also mention rows. I think the rules did a poor job here.

Respuesta 16:
I found the rules generally very clear. One rule was missing though - I created a rules thread about it, and an addendum was made to the advanced game rules:

 

I agree that the look and tactile nature of the tiles add to the game in this case, but I also firmly believe the game has a lot of merit on its own. After well over 100 games, I still feel that I am getting slightly better with each game.

I dislike MPS games too, but in Azul it's pretty obvious to me what I'm going to do with the tiles once I get them - there's not nearly as much time spent puzzling out your own board as there is in real MPS games.

The heart of the game is in the middle of the table where the factory tiles are. I also like that it's really easy to tell from a glance at your opponents' boards what they need and what they don't want - true MPS games often obscure this so much that it's hardly worth looking.

As far as I've noticed, every popular game gets lots of question threads in its rules forum, no matter how well written its rulebook is. It's the price of a game being popular. For very many popular games, the majority of rule questions posted are clearly answered in the rules. I don't think this can be blamed on the rulebook. A lot of people are just lazy or inattentive readers, or they learned the game from a friend and don't have the rulebook at hand, or whatever.

Would say the same thing about Gloomhaven or Sycthe? Because from my perception those are two games that are of zero interest to me, but others act as if they're the Second Coming.

Whatever game is seen as a great game for specific demographic is going to get hyped by that demographic and disparaged by others.

Me, I'd love to play deeper games, but I have a toddler and another on the way and I'm working all the time. I'm looking for games that have some depth in 45 minutes or less. Azul, for my current lifestyle, is one of the best games I've played all year. I happen to love games like Endeavor, but Azul is what's going to hit the table. And the hype helped me discover the game and now it's in heavy regular rotation.

So "uncalled for" is completely subjective.

I played Gloomhaven once and even if I did have the time to play it I would not choose that game. The Super Bowl hype machine for that game with its current #1 rank makes the hype around Azul look like a child's party. So if you want to say "uncalled for" I say look a further up the rankings beyond Azul.

At least Azul is a game available and open to anyone who has a little bit of time to play. Not many people have the time and energy to play Gloomhaven making its demographic rather small. That it's ranked number one tells me a minority of game players have a disproportionate amount of power over the rankings and hyping of games on BGG.



Tema 455: A second draw bag would be useful.
Pregunta:
I’ve started to use my bag from Clank in Space to put the discarded tiles in. Saves the time of putting them in the box and then refilling the Azul bag. Seems like a second Azul branded bag with a different color would be a nice option.

Respuesta 1:
But knowing what's in the discard pile can be helpful, so putting them in a bag would deprive you of knowledge.

We use clear glass bowls (which we use for all our game bits), and they make it easy to pour back in the bag when the bag is empty. You could just use any open storage device that's easy to pour into the bag.

Respuesta 2:
I put a second bag in the box for this very reason. If players prefer to have knowledge of what's coming up then as Kim says it's easy enough to use a bowl or container to place them in, which is then easy to pour back in. Either option is preferable to putting them into the box lid, which is then hard to pour back in because of the sharp corners.

Tema 456: Placing tiles in a filled row (or just straight to the floor) [ANSWERED]
Pregunta:
Sorry if this has been posted before, I tried searching for something similar and did not see anything.

Let's say I have an empty 5-Tile pattern row and a filled 4-Tile pattern row, filled with blue tiles. For this example. Let's say it is not possible to place any blue tiles in tile pattern rows 1-3, as blue tiles have already been placed on my mosaic on those rows.

I am now forced, as my last pick, to pick up one blue tile. Am I forced to place this tile on my 5-Tile pattern row? Or, can I choose to place it in my filled 4-Tile pattern row, and just have it go to the floor? Alternatively, can I just place the tile on the floor if I want to (I looked through the rulebook and I'm pretty sure you can't do this).

Respuesta 1:
You are indeed allowed to place it on the floor if you don't want to place it in a row. The only thing you are not allowed to is take multiple tiles of the same colour and place them in different rows during the same turn.

Tema 458: Quick Review
Pregunta:
As of writing this review, Azul is probably the hottest game around. Last month at my local Connecticut Convention, Azul was the most talked about game. It was difficult to buy a copy for some time but now can be found in stores. All the praise for the game is well deserved. So far as of April 2018, Azul is the game of the year.

The components are top notch. If you were impressed by Plan B Games' Century Spice Road components, then Azul will raise the bar of what to expect from future games by Plan B. The tiles are shiny, have excellent artwork, and have a good weight to them. I suggest you purchase an additional draw bag to help with gameplay. As you play, you will be creating a discard pile and having to add all the tiles back to the draw bag when empty. Having a second draw bag makes keeping the table more organized.

I have played Azul with all player counts, and it is perfect with every count. I have only played with the basic side of the player mat and looking forward to trying the advance side. The gameplay is simple, you pick a tile type from the factory plates and add to one of your rows on the player mat. The goal is to group tiles adjacent to each other in both the horizontal and vertical positions for max scoring. The unique aspect of the game is that you must have the exact number of tile willing filing a row to score. If you have extra tiles, they end up being negative points.

To win the game, you must have at least complete multiple of the end game bonuses. The bonuses are to collect five of one type of tile for ten points and complete columns for seven points.

The one thing to keep in mind is that there will be times when you have to take extra tiles for negative points. In multiple games, I have seen people fill the entire negative point row due to hate drafting and players not needing certain types of tiles. A few players have said they will never play the game again because of being on the wrong side of the drafting. I have had to fill the entire negative point row and came back to come in second in a four-player game. So don't think one lousy turn stops you from performing well in the game.

Azul is my favorite abstract game. The great components help but the mechanisms are excellent making the game stand out. I think every gaming group should have a copy.

Rating is 9.

are of course already on your board or the others').

The frequency is often to rare, and you are exactly right, if someone is paying attention they can deny it, but through clever play, you can often make it worth their while or a detriment to their score for them to not let you have the tiles you need

Respuesta 3:
If you're playing well and trying to fill either rows or columns, you're already getting good points from the placement of the tiles so the bonus is a small extra reward (I would say that the differing value of the two is partially because filling either of the top two rows is usually fairly easy, and also because you have to decide whether 2 points is enough for you to trigger the end of the game over). By comparison, getting 5 of a kind requires you to deliberately place tiles non-adjacently, so unless you're joining the spaces between them well you need those extra 10 points for it to be worth it. So it's essentially promoting an alternative strategy that you have to be somewhat committed to early in the game to have a hope of making it work, hence why it's not going to happen often.

Respuesta 4:
In our 2 player games we often end up going to 6 rounds and therefore it's not rare for us to have at least one colour get the all of that colour bonus.

The game will not last longer than 6 rounds, and usually
lasts only 5. Being able to get 15/20 tiles seems unlikely
(upgrade to impossible if your opponent is paying attention).
How much easier is it to do in 3- or 4-player games?
With 3, you see 140 tiles in 5 rounds, but there's another
opponent taking tiles, and you may not see that much of the
color you're collecting in the later rounds (and some of them
are of course already on your board or the others').

In the competitive two player games I play in, I'd say someone gets five of a kind maybe once in every ten games. Every game ends with both players having at least four of a kind though.

When we're playing four player games I find that we frequently end up in situations where someone ends up having to decide which person to screw over, and which person to let have five of a kind.

Respuesta 8:
About 90% of my Azul plays are with my spouse. We often play to six rounds (i.e., refilling the bag) in order to complete a couple of columns before completing a row. If you play that style, it's not hard to earn the five-of-a-color bonus... in fact, last game we played, I filled two sets (black and blue) and he filled one (turquoise). That's pretty rare, though.

Doesn’t matter how you define it; not everyone would adhere and people would still disagree and/or complain.

For example, I disagree with the idea that Azul and Splendor are on the same level as Hungry Hungry Hippos and Love Letter. In a system where those are Light games, Azul/Splendor would be the next level up for me.

All ratings, regardless of a ‘key’, should be taken in direction not necessarily magnitude.

No. This kind of system surely wouldn't suffice. It's totally subjective and I, like many others in this thread have stated, don't agree with it. There's no way I would put Hungry Hippos or Love Letter in the same bucket as Azul or Splendor. I don't even feel Hungry Hippos and Love Letter should be in the same bucket. I would also absolutely place Concordia in the same bucket as Puerto Rico or Agricola.

Just because a game has fewer rules doesn't mean it is lighter - I prefer to call that elegance.

Just because a game has a "long and technical ruleset" doesn't mean it is heavy. Arkham horror has an incredible number of fiddly rules but I definitely consider it as a game on the lightest side of medium.

I could go on, but this debate has been done many, many times here already. No one system will ever satisfy everyone.

This.
To the OP, would you put Go and Chess in the "light" category as well? Games with minis and 64-page rulebooks might also be rather light on the other hand, provided they don't have much depth, more like 'roll and see what's going to happen'. (I'm not saying they are, but having minis and complex rules does not necessarily mean heavy.)

No. Chess is a medium weight game. Chess is nowhere near as heavy as 18XX or Infinity. The decision trees in both those games are exponentially higher than Chess.
Good luck in defeating Go and Chess grand masters then. (I'm not sure about the decision tree comparison between Chess and those games, but I'd be rather surprised if they had a decision tree higher than Go. On the other hand I don't know when and who said that decision tree complexity is the only measure for the weight of a game.)

I can't see a weight scale that forces you to lump Hungry hippos in with Azul as being a useful scale.


Azul has lots of strategy to think through - playing 2 player you can think ahead and try and consider the whole round, and plan accordingly to avoid being left with a pile of tiles on your floor, as well as focussing on longer term plans as to how to maximize scoring. There are many threads where people can't get their head around the scoring, and I know from teaching the game that some people do find it hard to grok.

Hungry hippos has you pressing a lever as fast as possible, and could be played by a 2 year old.

Respuesta 11:
So what we're really arguing about is the DEFINITION of the weight, not the weight relative to other similar games?

The fact that a majority of people lumped it in at the 2 mark makes a lot of sense to me. It's pretty light. But there's more going on than the likes of Hungry Hungry Hippos, Loopin' Louie, Jenga or Snap.

OP would it make you happy if they simply relabelled the scale as:

1 - super light
2 - light
3 - lightish mediumish
4 - mediumish heavyish
5 - heavy

From the page linked above:

For different people weight means different things, usually a combination of things like:

How complex/thick is the rulebook?
How long does it take to play?
What proportion of time is spent thinking and planning instead of resolving actions?
How hard and long do you have to think to improve your chance of winning?
How little luck is in the game?
How much technical skill (math, reading ahead moves, etc) is necessary?
How long does it take to learn the rules?
How many times do you need to play before you feel like you "get" the game?
To me, Azul seems heavier than Jenga on all of those.

Why is your interpretation the objectively correct one? Other people have found that the game is on the heavier side for them that you found it for yourself. That should not be a surprise since people are, you know, different. They learn differently and have different experiences and everything. The whole point of the communal rating system is to suss out the average experience. You're getting mad about how averages work.

Right, because only that many plays gives someone the ability to speak to how weighty they found the game to begin with. Also, people with that many plays would have internalized the game so much that they would tend to weight things lighter. Part of the weight is learning curve. Allowing only the 'elite' players of the game who have racked up that many plays would flatten that out, making it less objective. You're also implicitly assuming that people with that many plays would agree with you on what the weight is, since you are declaring which things have the right and wrong weights, which just brings me back to the response to the first quote.

IMO - extra rows deflate the tension in the game.

Respuesta 3:

7x7 - this was just quite loose really. and to get those 6 and 7 tile spots took a long time. I can only recommend this with 2 players or you will just have tiles stuck in those bottom rows for several turns. Granted, there were more turns in the game itself as a row was bigger. Also nearly impossible to get 7 of one colour on the board!

7 colours on b sides - we much preferred this one, but it still wasn't great. it clogged up the rows, so basically you had A LOT of tiles down the bottom of your board in the broken tiles section. So lots of negative points. Also, it was extremely hard to get 5 of one colour on the board. however, rows and columns were MUCH easier.

to be fair, these modes were a fun little mess around. But ultimately just detracted from what is a fantastic little game.

we now just pick 5 colours and always use B sides (which i think are better anyway!)

If having 7 rows is problematic, would 7x5 be better? It would still allow for those 7 color rows, with none of the nonsense of having to get 7 tiles of a type to place in the longest row...

I assume you played these with just 4 tiles per factory still. I can see why that would be incredibly slow to fill the longer rows with.

Might it work better if you upped it to 6 tiles per factory instead, getting more tiles out faster, making it easier to fill the latter rows and more perilous filling the earlier rows?

Overview and Theme

Azul takes its theme from Portugese history, when the then King was amazed by the Moorish decorative tiles used in an Alhambra in southern Spain. He immediately set workers to using the stunning tiles to decorate the walls of his palace in Evora. The players of Azul take on the roles of a tiler, seeking to create the best work of art to impress the King.

Like many a game, especially abstracts, the theme starts and stops here. Certainly the theme does come through in the use of tiles and what you are trying to do, but you don't really give this little backstory and real thought during the play. In truth Azul is a pattern building and tile placement game, with some interesting tile acquisition rules.

Azul was possibly the biggest sleeper hit to come out of Essen 2017. I remember seeing some of the buzz in the Con forums during the event and by November it was popping up everywhere. It took me until January to acquire a copy and I'm glad I did.

The designer Michael Kiesling , is of course part of the famous Kramer & Kiesling duo that were responsible for the classics, Torres , Tikal , Java  and Mexica , with the first two winning the Spiel des Jahres (SdJ) in 1999 and 2000.

I may be in the minority but Wolfgang Kramer  has always come across as the more famous of the duo, perhaps because Kramer has had other hits outside of the partnership. In doing some research for this review I was surprised to see how many designs the pair have created together and continue to create even in 2017 and those slated for a 2018 release. They are still going very strong some 20 years later.

But Azul is a moment for Kiesling to stand alone. So are all the positive vibes surrounding Azul warranted? What is it that is so appealing to so many?

Grab a tile and give me 10 minutes of your time...we are about to find out.



The Components

Azul is a relatively simple production, but the quality in its main component is a large part of the games appeal (visual and otherwise).

Boards – Each player needs access to their own personal board. They are decently thick affairs that feature two sides to allow for two forms of play.

The boards consist of 4 key areas. At the top can be found a scoring track, which is personal to each player. This is well designed, offering nice easy to see 5-point increments and it is ordered in such a way that moving your scoring token one position down represents a gain of 20 points exactly. Call me a geek but I like little touches like this.

At the bottom of each board can be found a horizontal set of boxes, with associated negative values that increase from -1 through to -3 (more on these in due course). These boxes are called the Floor Line. In the bottom right corner can be found a concise summary of the end of game scoring bonuses.

But the main parts of the board are the two sections found in the middle. The left side acts as a series of holding boxes, in which tiles that are acquired can be placed. This is referred to as the 'Pattern Lines', I'm going to refer to them as holding boxes for simplicity's sake. It looks like a set of steps with each row offering one more box than the last (each row contains 1-5 boxes).

To the right of this section sits a colourful mosaic of tile art (these match the tiles used in the game). This section serves as the palace wall that each player is trying to adorn with gorgeous tiles.

The rear side of the boards are almost identical. The only change is that the colourful 'Wall' is replaced with bland grey squares instead.

I'm going to be a little critical here and say that the boards are a little disappointing in regards to one facet, I refer to the quality of the edging on them. I'm being a touch picky but the raw (exposed) edges seem beneath the production of the rest of the game. A bevelled or tapered edge, perhaps using the same material as the tiles would have elevated the boards considerably.

I would happily welcome a premium edition of the game in the future with such additions (already new tiles are being offered up as well as a premium '1' token).

I suspect it may happen if the game continues to do well beyond the current hotness. Perhaps a 10-year Anniversary Edition?

Tiles – It is the tiles though that are the star of the Azul show. These gorgeous square tiles come in 5 different types, with each being coloured or patterned in a different way. Apart from their colourful visage, what makes them special is the resin material they are made from. A bit like Samurai , which I covered earlier this year, I don't think they are made using Bakelite, but a resin in the same family.

The tiles are just beautiful to the touch and give the game a wonderful tactile feel. They also make a most satisfying clinking sound as they are mixed in the cloth, drawstring bag.

It continues to amaze me how we, as gamers, can be drawn to something so simple as quality tiles or pieces in a game. But it shouldn't be surprising I guess, given our (human's) appreciation of art and such.

In all there are 100 tiles in the box, 20 of each type.

Plates and Tokens – The game then provides 9 cardboard discs adorned with patterns. The game tries to enhance the theme by referring to these as Factory Plates, implying that the tiles you are looking to acquire and use in your wall have come straight from the factory.

To me this seems a little clunky and unnecessary but it is what it is. I prefer to simply call them plates or platters and be done with it.

These are fairly functional from a game play point of view, as they serve as a location to place tiles upon each round. The artwork is nice enough without being outstanding.

Four black small cubes represent the player's Scoring Tokens and are sized to fit on the spaces used in the scoring track nicely.

Azul also comes with a Start Player Token that features the number '1'. In the first printing this came as a cardboard token. Already the company is offering a premium replacement tile, made from the same resin as the main tiles. I suspect this will become a regular inclusion in future print runs.

Cloth Bag – In a sign of how far we have come (in regards to expecting quality components in our games) Azul comes with a printed, well sized and attractive, drawstring cloth bag. I respect a bag that has plenty of space to put your hand into and be able to mix the contents around comfortably.

Once upon a time clever gamers (or their partners) would make custom material bags like this. Azul has us covered already.

Rules – The rules are a great example of being only as big as they need to be whilst still including important examples and text spacing. It makes them very easy to read and a snap for the game to be learned.

Existing game players might have been Azul's main target market, but its rule book and overall presentation will certainly help it attract and support a wider audience.

Azul is an excellent production from Plan B Games  to be sure and is well worth its asking price. I'll even give a shout out to the insert used by the game. Everything has a nice custom spot for it including the Start Player Token, which is recessed below the spaces that the Factory Plates sit in. Cuuuuute!

Set-Up

Azul has almost no set-up before play can begin. This is largely due to the fact that the tiles stay in the cloth bag upon packing the game away.

All that is needed is to place a number of Factory Plates on the table (ranging from 5-9 depending on the number of players). The Start Player Token is placed in the center of the plates and each player takes a board and scoring token, placing it at zero.

Each plate is filled with 4 randomly selected tiles, a start player is chosen and the game is ready to begin.

The Play

In keeping with the strengths of abstract designs, Azul uses a minimum of rules to define its play, which then create interesting decisions for the players.

Take Tiles – On a player's turn they are wanting to take tiles, which they will eventually use to tile their Wall.

Tiles can be taken from two possible areas, but the golden rule is that only tiles of one type can be taken on a single turn and all tiles available of the type selected must be taken...whether you want them all or not.

Those two options are :-

Take Tiles from a Single Factory Plate – A player can only take tiles in an offering by taking all tiles of one type. Given the game has 5 tile types, it is often the case that many a plate offers 4 unique tiles or only a pair of a given tile type.

If tiles are taken from a Factory Plate, those that are not taken are moved to the central area. This leads to the second tile taking option.

Take Tiles from the Central Area – The central area of the table (the area inside all of the Factory Plates) can bulge with tiles if the players favour tiles found on the Factory Plates.

So option two for the players is to take tiles from the central area, but again, they must take all tiles of a single type if they take from the center. The first player to take from the center must take the '1' Start Player token. This guarantees them first pick in the next round, but it also costs them negative points. The token must be placed in the first available box to the far left of the Floor Line. Usually taking the Start Player Token will cost a player -1 victory point.

Naturally the option to take from the center area is not possible if no tiles currently reside there.

Add Tiles to Rows – Once a player has taken their selection of a tile or tiles, they must add them to the holding boxes in the center-left of their board. This is a location where a player can hold tiles in preparation for Wall Tiling.

A player is only allowed to have tiles of one type in a single row. If a player takes more tiles than are needed to fill a row, the excess must be placed in the Floor Line (leftmost available boxes), costing the player negative points. Multiple rows can feature tiles of the same type and a player need not complete one row before starting another row with the same type of tile (although it may at times be unwise).

Let's look at an example. In the image on the right, a player has 2 empty spots in the blue tile row. If they were to take a set of 3 blue tiles they could complete the blue row but they would have one excess blue tile, which would be placed in the leftmost Floor Line box, costing the player (in this case) -1 point. They cannot place that one excess blue tile in the empty top row. So in other words, a single taking of tiles can only be used to fill (or partially) fill a single row on a single turn.

A Restriction – A key rule however is that a player cannot add tiles of a given type to a row in their holding area, if that tile type already exists in their Wall, in that row. This may seem confusing now, but will make total sense by the end of this section. To help remember this, there are a set of triangles that point from each row in the holding area to the adjoining row in a player's Wall area.

Ending the Tile Selection Phase – The play continues to move from one player to another until all tiles available for the round have been taken. All tiles must be added to a player's holding area or placed in the empty boxes of their Floor Line (where they will earn negative points).

When must a player place tiles in their Floor Line?

It is quite possible that some players may be forced to take tiles that they cannot place in their holding rows. This can be caused by having to take too many tiles of a given type (more than you have room for in a single row) or by having all rows started on their board and being forced to take tiles of a type that do not match (because a single row can only feature tiles of one type).

When this occurs, these tiles must be added to the Floor Line on a player's board. As per taking the Start Player Token, all tiles placed in this way must be placed to the far left of the Floor Line. Each spot in this row has a negative VP value, so the more boxes that are filled in this line, the more negative points a player will accrue for the round. This is, shall we say, undesirable.

Wall Tiling – In this phase the players have the opportunity to move tiles from their holding area to the right-side of their board, which represents the wall they have been assigned in the King's Palace.

Filling this wall serves as the aim of the game as it is how the players score points. But how do they do it?

A player is allowed to move tiles from the left to the right of their boards when they complete a horizontal row in their holding area. Naturally it is very easy to fill in the 1, 2 and even the 3 long rows...but the 4 and 5 length rows take a little more work.

For each row that has been filled in, a player is allowed to move one of those tiles across to the right, placing that tile on the location that matches the tile itself. This is the only location a tile can be placed and given that each row of tiles in the Wall features each tile exactly once, we learn a new restriction of Azul.

That is, once a player has filled in a wall section with a given tile type, they cannot ever place those same tiles in that row of their holding area again!

The process of moving a tile from the holding area to the Wall, is always done from the top down, with any rows that were not filled in being skipped over. This is important because each tile that is added to a player's Wall will earn points!

How many points though depends on how they go about filling in their Wall.

This phase can be carried out simultaneously by the players, saving on time. In my experience though, the players like to go around the table and see the points that are being scored. It helps to keep track of how everyone is travelling and makes for a more collaborative experience. It doesn't really add that much time to the playing of the game and the players may learn something about the nature of their opponent's boards that may help them strategically in future rounds, when it comes to what tiles to take and what to leave.

Scoring –

Image Courtesy of mcfer
Every time a tile is added to a player's Wall it will be scored. A tile scores based on how many other tiles it is connected to in both a vertical and horizontal fashion. Thus a tile added to your Wall in isolation to any other tiles is worth 1 point. If a tile is placed with one tile below it and two tiles to its right, it will score 5 points. This is because it has formed a chain of two tiles vertically and a three-tile chain horizontally. This reminds me very much of the scoring used in Qwirkle .

This highlights why it is important to add tiles to your Wall from top to bottom as it will have an impact on the scoring.

Each player must of course reflect the points they have earned by moving their scoring marker on their personal scoring track at the top of their board, remembering to deduct any negative points earned by filled boxes in their Floor Line. I guess thematically the Floor Line represents tiles that are dropped and broken on the floor?

When all players have updated their scores the game can progress. Well almost.

Any tiles left over in the holding area (those not added to a player's Wall) are removed from their board and placed to the side of the table. This not only frees up space in a player's holding area, but it also makes those tiles available again for future use once the bag contains no more tiles to draw (not immediately).

Any tiles that have scored negative points in a player's Floor Line are also removed in the same fashion.

Re-setting for a New Round and Triggering the Endgame – If no one has triggered the endgame, the Factory Plates must be refilled. This is the same process as in the set-up, drawing 4 tiles at random from the bag to fill each plate. If the bag becomes empty during this process, all tiles that have been discarded to the table are returned to the bag to be drawn.

There can come a time when there are not enough tiles to fill all plates (usually 4-player games). In this case plates are filled as much as they can be.

The player that took the '1' Start Player Token last round returns it to the central area and they begin the new round by making the first selection.

Triggering the Endgame – This actually occurs in the Tile Walling phase. If a player manages to fill in any one of their horizontal rows in their Wall, the game will end immediately at the end of the current round (allowing all player's to score one last time).

Because the players cannot add more than 1 tile to any horizontal row in their Wall in a single round, the players need to pay attention to the position of all players and recognise when time may be running out. But by the same token the end-game trigger also gives the players some form of control and knowledge so they should not be totally surprised when the game does end. This is a nice feature for any game, but particularly an abstract design, where total chaos and luck are undesirable traits.

End Game Bonus Scoring – Azul then offers up 3 ways to earn bonus points. For every completed horizontal row in a Wall, 2 points are earned (of course at least one player must score this bonus if the game is to come to an end and it is possible to complete several horizontal rows in the final round).

For every completed vertical column in a Wall, 7 points are earned. These are harder to complete because it requires filling in the longer 4 and 5 box rows of the holding area and then targeting a single vertical column in your wall. You are doing very well to complete 2 or more vertical columns in a single game.

The final bonus is worth a whopping 10 points, and is awarded for every type of tile that features all 5 times in your Wall. Going for this bonus can often be at the expense of scoring the other bonuses, such is the challenge of dominating the taking of tiles of a single type.

The player with the highest score after the bonus points are awarded takes the win. In the event of a tie, the win goes to the tied player that has completed the more horizontal rows in their Wall. If this too is tied, the players share the win.

Summary – I'll try something new here in an effort to summarise the flow of the game.

Take Tiles => Place them in your holding area

Complete rows in your holding area in order to add a tile to your Wall => Score higher points by adding tiles to form orthogonal chains

Try to complete rows and columns in your Wall and\or add 5 tiles of one type to your wall => Trigger bonus scoring


What drives the game is the rules for taking tiles, trying to collect what you need and leaving the opposition with tiles that may hinder their progress or even score them negative points.

Playing with the Variant

Image Courtesy of Toynan


The Variant form of play uses the side of the board with the greyed-out 'Wall' and the implications may be obvious. There is no given location for a tile of any type to go and that means the players are free to place tiles as they wish in any location, provided that a single tile type does not feature twice in any horizontal row or vertical column. This makes for more flexibility in the 'taking' of tiles in the short term.

What does it do to the game? Does it change it up much or at all? Of course it does to some degree and I've only played the game this way once. To me the variant was no more or less compelling. What it does do is brake up a player's strategy if they have a preferred way to play in the normal format (they tend to go after certain colours because of where they are located on the Wall), but it doesn't change that much.

I was hoping for a real game changer with the variant but I don't think it is.

The Final Word

Azul is another great design in its own right and a quality addition to the line of modern abstract designs released over the last 30 years. It is very much a puzzle and the challenge is to best assess the game-state as it changes and make the most of it. The tension comes from getting what you need before another players takes those tiles away from you. The game allows for forward planning but there is an element of luck too, in what tiles are available each round. That said, there are enough tiles drawn each round to usually provide you with some pretty good plays, even if they weren't the killer move you were aiming for. This is one of the great appeals of Azul, it allows its players to accomplish things and make them feel successful, even if another player is making slightly better progress (and that isn't always highly evident).

Another strength of Azul is that it can be played at effectively two speeds. It can be played at a more relaxed level with each player more or less selecting tiles for their own purposes and not worrying too much about the opposition. When playing like this all of the players feel like they are making good moves and accomplishing things as they complete rows and add tiles to their Wall. For the conflict averse, Azul can be a winner.

But Azul can be played at a higher level as well, allowing those that think their way through games to get better with experience. Playing more competitively requires a careful consideration of what tiles the opposition are looking for and the current state of their holding area rows. There is something quite satisfying about making plays that result in other players being forced to take more tiles than they really wanted or being left short of what they really needed. I'm not suggesting that Azul reaches any Chess  like level, or even Hive  for that matter, because this is not a perfect information game. You won't ever find yourself disliking the game because of a disparity in skill level. But it can and will reward the shrewd player more often than not.

If abstract games are not your thing I would encourage you to give Azul a try. The beauty here is that it is pretty difficult to screw other players over on a regular basis if they are paying attention. So what results is a game where positive outcomes outweigh the negative ones. It helps make the game feel inclusive and that will appeal to many a game player.

That is probably the biggest difference between Santorini  (which I covered last year) or Hive  and Azul. As much as I love Santorini, players can get that 'argh...I didn't see that move!' feeling. In Azul the players don't tend to mind the result at the end of the play, it's quite the relaxed gaming experience.

Another positive with Azul is that the margins for victory tend to be pretty tight (between the leading players at least) and the scoring system is such that the players are not quite sure who will come out on top in the final analysis. This helps all players to feel like they are in with a shot right to the end and it might only take 3-4 negative points to deny someone else the win and see you slip ahead. That's a pretty good positive for any game and it means that Azul can reward clever players without making anyone feel like they have been hammered mercilessly all game long.

At the heart of what makes Azul work as an experience though is the combination of tile collection rules and the scoring rules. Azul is a great example of an open design in that a player can go about scoring points in a number of different ways and do fairly well. There isn't only one strategy to secure victory and the players really need to assess the factory offerings each turn and assess the needs of their opponents if they want to secure the right tiles and score well...as often as possible.

The final feather in Azul's cap is the fact that it plays in a really nice length of time. It doesn't outstay its welcome and I suspect most groups play at least two games in a row once the game is off the shelf. It also plays really well at any play count. I actually find that there is a bit more 'tile pain' (being forced to take tiles you don't want or can't use) in the 2-player game than when playing with 3 or 4 players. But we are cracking out 2-player games in 15-20 minutes. At that length the reward to time investment is in the positive ledger for sure.

Azul is in my experience, the 3rd high-quality abstract game to make a big splash in the last 7 years, following on the heels of Indigo  (2012), Onitama  (2014) and Santorini  (2016). It begs the question why abstract game designs are so popular at the moment? Is it a case of over-saturation of point-salad designs, euro cube-pushers and miniature heavy themed conflict games? Is it more the fact that people are finding rule-light, easy access, strategy-rich games desirable in this time-poor world we find ourselves in? I suspect it is more the later than the former but there is no doubt that abstract designs have really shone through since 2001 when Hive  seemed to kickstart the genre again.

For me Azul is a great title that deserves a place in most game-fan's collections. I look forward to playing it for years to come and it is a versatile title that can appeal to family groups as much as it can with gaming circles.

Now that is one fine review

Respuesta 2:
The 1st player tile has already been included in the current print run as well as future. If you buy the game form any online retailer today, you should get the 1st player tile.

Secondly, yes the publisher created some tiles to give out to 1st edition owners, but they ran out very, very quickly. So I don't think many early adopters will be able to get the individual tile at this point.

To re-state what the user above me noted, it's true that you can't copy the tile type in a vertical column OR horizontal row on the variant side of the board, but the rules did not make this as clear as they should have (we made the same mistake at first).

Edit: I also prefer the printed side of the board versus the variant. With the added flexibility on the variant side, it's very difficult to anticipate what other players need, reducing the amount of strategy in the game.

A player is only allowed to have tiles of a single type in each row. If a row has been started but is incomplete, it must be finished before that colour (tile type) can be used in another row. If they manage to complete a row with a given tile type, they are allowed to start a new row using that type of tile if they wish.

Let's look at an example. In the image on the right, a player has 2 empty spots in the blue tile row. If they were to take a set of 3 blue tiles they could complete the blue row and use the remaining tile to fill the top row as well.

Once all spaces of a pattern line are filled, that line is considered complete. If you have picked up more tiles than you can place in your chosen pattern line, you must place the excess tiles in the floor line (see Floor line).
Nope. The Neil has. Phew!

Also, I cannot see anything in the rules that says if I start a pattern line in a colour, I must complete that line before I can use that colour in a different line.

The Variant form...

Perhaps it is a little but more forgiving in that the same coloured tiles can be used in the same horizontal row.
This is incorrect. Same rules apply as in the base game.
Thanks for the pick-up.

The English Rules are poorly written then in that section as they overtly state that the game remains the same. It then explicitly points out that no tile of the same type can appear more than once in a vertical line. This implies that the same isn't the case for horizontal lines.

Edit made.

Dang it...of all the games...

We actually learned this one by watching a group at a Con and they taught us this rule. My partner then re-read the rules months later and re-taught me...keeping this non-rule in place (about not being able to start another line with a tile type that has a row incomplete).

This is one of the few reviews when I haven't read the rule book from start to finish myself...Got caught out.

Thanks for the pick-ups - review edited for accuracy.

Besides the already mentioned rules-mishaps, good review

Respuesta 8:
I agree on the player boards. The bare edges are going to show wear, particularly on the corners. I imagine I will end up reinforcing the corners with a dab of wood glue. But the cardboard stock they used for those boards also feels cheap and have shown to be vulnerable to warping. Though the boards have nice graphical design, their quality is not on par with the rest of the game.

Respuesta 9:
At the board game cafe we run we spray games we know will get heavy use with a varnish. Doesn't help the corners but the board holds up incredibly well after hundreds of plays already.

It doesn't work well at all despite my efforts in trying

Respuesta 3:
Just add two factories per player and of course a set of 25 tiles per player.
5 or 6-player offers a nearly identical gaming experience as 4-player. I've played up to 7 players and it did get a little overwhelming with the potential AP and the time between plays. But 5 and 6 are almost the norm in my groups.

Respuesta 4:
Yikes - I prefer not to play it with more than 3!

Respuesta 5:
My initial assumption would be that this would end up changing the "center factory" dynamic quite a bit, with early players being able to get away with more/better points, and later players being stuck with heavier penalties.

Did you notice anything like that?

Respuesta 6:
The upcoming Mystic Vale big box expansion includes components to expand the game from 4 to 6 players, and a new rule to speed up gameplay. Basically you form two separate markets, a "day" and "night" market, and there are two turn tokens passing around corresponding to them. This lets two players take turns simultaneously without affecting each other.

Hypothetically the same thing could work for many games, including Azul I'd imagine.

Respuesta 7:
I would love a five player option as that's the number at my gaming nights
Rather than adding a couple of factories, has anyone tried putting five tiles on a disk instead of four and changing the chart to rows of 2-7 instead of 1-6?



Tema 464: 2p vs 4p
Pregunta:
My first dozen games of Azul were in a 4p setting, but since I received my own copy, most of my games are 2p against my wife. As with other games, tactical considerations change considerably as in 2p, every point you deny to your opponent directly scores for you, whereas in 4p doing the best move for yourself usually is better than doing a move which hurts one of your opponents (of course you can always encourage others to "take one for the team" ).

With 2p the "chaos factor" is way smaller, and the game becomes more predictable. With 4p, it's often hard to assess which options you'll have when it's your turn again, as the situation can change quite dramatically, and a nice opportunity may come into existence and disappear again without you having a chance to use it. Also, with 4p it's more important who takes the "1" stone: Do I take it and get a not-so-great set of tile from the center, but start the next round? How likely is it that the player behind me will take it, as being 4th next round can be quite painful.

How do others feel about this? Do you like it better with 4p (which doesn't lend itself to planning ahead so much as to react to whatever situation you find when it's your turn) or 2p (which allows -and requires- more planning ahead)?

Respuesta 1:
I actually love this dynamic! 3player is a nice in between. Me and my wife play it a lot and it forces me to be nice sometimes instead of mean but I love the planning aspect. In 4 players it flexes other muscles like plan as you go and being about to be flexible as well as read everyone elses wish list. I know you said all that!

But to conclude it depends on my mood! I'm more of a planner by nature so i like it 2player better but I love the challenge of 4player but i'm fully aware someone might win by having a lucky last round draw if i'm not careful!

Respuesta 2:
I think this game plays well at all player counts. Two-player is great since it's a different strategy than higher player counts due to only going through the tile bag once if you likely stick to 5 rounds. This is part of why I love this game so much, it's just a different experience.

Respuesta 3:
My husband and I have played 2 players extensively. We've found a few things a little frustrating: 1) that attaining families is far less likely because all the other tiles still floating around in the bag will make the probability of the ones you still need coming up drop significantly. 2) "two player-ism" takes effect, where you are constantly weighing your options between benefit to yourself and harm to your single other opponent. This tends to make the game a little flat, versus the variety of situations you get when more people are making choices that are less predictable.

We've tried using only half the tiles to help with issue #1, but we found ourselves running out of tiles toward the end of the game because we had so many hanging out on our boards. I wonder if seeding the bag with just enough tiles (1 or 2 more of each type?) to ensure that there will be no blank factories might help with this. This would be an exception from the written rule about running out of tiles, because I'm guessing the game designers were assuming a 4-player game for this situation, not a modified 2-player.

I also thought about either A) creating a dummy 3rd player to help with issue #2, that each player takes turns manipulating the third player's choices, or B) each player plays on two boards apiece, in staggered order, again to address issue #2.

Has anyone tried these modifications or seen levels of success with them?

Respuesta 4:
Confused about number 1 - in a standard 5-round 2p game you're guaranteed to see each tile exactly once.

Number 2 is exactly what I like about the 2p game, but that's a matter of taste.

I also thought about either A) creating a dummy 3rd player to help with issue #2, that each player takes turns manipulating the third player's choices, or B) each player plays on two boards apiece, in staggered order, again to address issue #2.
B) sounds interesting. I reckon that the winner should then be decided by whose lower result is better.

Another (untested, just came to my head ) idea for a dummy player could involve rolling a die:

1) right from the start of the game, use six factories instead of five, and assign the numbers 1-6 -
2) at the beginning of each round, draw four (or whatever count you like) of tiles from the bag and directly put them into the lid (players can see which ones)
3) Dummy player plays only one action each round, right after each human player has taken one action.
4) The dummy player action works like this: one of the players rolls the die and empties the factory with that number (reroll until a non-empty factory is hit) - these four tiles go into the lid

The effect of 2) is that it adds randomness (or luck, if you prefer ) by randomly removing some tiles until the bag needs to be refilled.

The effect of 3-4) is that it adds some randomness/luck too, plus it makes it harder for the human players to "optimize" their initial move.

I totally agree. I have played a bunch of games from all player counts and can honestly say that it’s one of the few games that is equally enjoyable at all counts. The only real difference in my opp. Is the length. Some times on lunch break at work I will crack it out with a friend and play a quick 2p game (we have actually done 4ptoo but 2p goes in 20 mins which fits lunch break nicely).

Tema 466: PAX East First Look: Azul
Pregunta:
I finally got a chance to play Azul for the first time in the first look section of the Tabletop Area. I had heard great things about the game but I am extremely shy so starting a game seemed impossible. Luckily, two other players and I converged on the game at the same time and just sat down. A PAX Enforcer taught us the rules quickly and there was a lot of rules referencing for our first two rounds, but after that we were able to move forward with no more rules look up.

I really liked the simplicity of the turns: picking the tiles and placing the tiles on your board. The scoring rules, like I have seen with other players, took a little getting used to. Once I reassured myself, it was just Qwirkle scoring rules and the tiles move over one at a time, it made perfect sense. It definitely falls into the category of group solitaire games. Everyone has their own tableau and only interact in the sense that they compete in selecting resources from a common market.

The game was very quiet with players thoughtfully considering their turns. While it didn't drag in our game, I could see a sand timer being needed for some players.

In the end, the scores were close between myself and another player. I missed out on first place by 1 point but the third player was way behind us. Although, I don't like how the scoring is done individually. While I trust other players, I had no way to verify scores.

Things I liked
+ Simple rules, simple turns
+ Meaningful choices, needed to tactically look ahead to other players' boards
+ Unique theme
+ Nice component quality

Things I didn't like
- I don't like the individual scoring areas (Should have a shared track for all players)
- Cardboard first player marker (I'm told this is addressed in future editions)

You will find this becomes much less true with additional experience.

Not that it pays to go out of your way to be mean, but there are certainly times when you have a choice of actions that are equally beneficial to you, but picking the "right" one can mess with your opponent(s).

Respuesta 2:
I could definitely see that happening. I had a choice between two tile types and I chose one to make the person after me drop 3 tiles. It was a little mean but worth it since he was running away with an early lead on points.



Tema 467: scoring unclear...
Pregunta:
Question #1
**************************************
If we place one tile to complete a column of 3.

Do we get 3 or 4 ? rules is really unclear on this.


(1 for the row) + (3 for the column) = 4 ?

or only 3 for the column ?

Question #2
*************************************
If we place 2 adjacent tile?

It's 2 points or 3 points?

*************************************

So do we get the extra individual tile point ONLY when it's in a combo set?


At my sense, the rule can be more easy to understand if we "always" add all column + all row points? So individual tile should scoore 2 ?!?

The column point (i) and the row point (1).



Anyway!

Really enjoy if someone can clarify this for my futurs games!

Respuesta 1:
Think of it as Scrabble scoring.

If you place one word, you count the word once. If you play a word that intersects and completes another word (or adds on), you score both words.

Respuesta 2:
In Azul, a column is 2 or more tiles aligned vertically, and a row is 2 or more tiles aligned horizontally. The special case is a tile by itself, which is not a row or a column, but you still get 1 point for it instead of 0.

So to answer question #1, you get 3 points, because you're counting a column of 3 and no row.

For question #2, it depends what you mean. If you are scoring two tiles one after the other, and the second is adjacent to the first, then you will end up getting 3 points total, 1 for the first tile and 2 for the second (since it's in a column of 2). If you are scoring a tile adjacent to one which is already there, you will get 2 points for that individual tile (presumably you got points for the other tile in a previous round).

You only get to count a tile twice while scoring if it is in both a row and a column as defined above.

Respuesta 3:
If you place a tile and it is not connected to any other tile, it is worth 1 point.

If it is horizontally connected, you get a point for each tile in that connected row.

If it is vertically connected, you get a point for each tile in that connectec column.

If it is connected both horizontally and vertically, you add both point values together.

I think it's easy to miss the key phrase "linked to..." in the rules for scoring. As others have said, if there is nothing linked in the column or row where you placed the tile the score for that column or row is zero.

M Stock
@rules
• If there are any tiles adjacent, however, do the following:

First check if there are 1 or more tiles horizontally linked
to the newly placed tile. If so, count all these linked tiles
(including the newly placed one) and gain that many points.

Then check if there are 1 or more tiles vertically linked to the
newly placed tile. If so, count all these linked tiles (including
the newly placed tile) and gain that many points.

***********************************
French rules:

It's telling us to do the following 2 steps when any adjacent tile.

1- Count the adjacent tiles in row (including the newly placed one)

2- Count the adjacent tiles in column (including the newly placed one)

Without that key phrase ... newly placed tile is count twice!

Fail there!

It doesn't matter which way will give you more points. Heck, by that logic, you'd wait until the end of the game to score anything! You score each tile as you move it, and you always move tiles from the top down. In other words:
1. Is there one tile in the one-tile row? If so, move it and score it immediately.
2. Are there two tiles in the two-tile row? If so, move one and score it immediately. Then discard the other tile in the row.
3. Repeat for the three-tile row.
4. Repeat for the four-tile row.
5. Repeat for the file-tile row.

Generally, I don't think you get significantly more or fewer points with more players, since in general you should have approximately the same number of tiles available to you. But trust me, with good placement and end-game bonuses (especially the 7 points for a column and the 10 for the five-tile bonus) you can absolutely near or break 100 in this game. Later in the game, you'll be scoring 5-9 points per tile.

Yes, you score each tile as you lay it. But remember, you move and score them from top to bottom. So in your example, you would move the tile in the top row first, and it would only score one since it lacks any adjacency. Then you would move the tile in row 2, scoring 4, as it completes a column of 4.

You don't score a point just for laying the tile, as you seemed to indicate.

In short, yes you score the tiles immediately, as each is moved. But you must perform this top to bottom.

Respuesta 12:
So, ignore the Scrabble bit, I think that's just confusing things.

Respuesta 16:
I believe what is confusing to everyone is whether to count the lone tile in a direction when there is no other tile adjacent to it.

I've seen several people make that +1 count but the rules seem to imply that this is incorrect.

Basically you just follow the rules explicitly as stated.

If placing a tile you look for adjacent tiles vertically first. If there are none then you count zero in that direction. Otherwise count the number of tiles in the vertical line.

Then look in the horizontal direction. Are there any tiles adjacent? If not you count zero in the horizontal direction. Otherwise count the number of tiles in the horizontal row.

If there are tiles adjacent in both directions you sum the counts from both directions.

That's how we interpret the rules.

Though I still see even experienced gamers counting that lone tile along the direction even if no other tiles are adjacent.

YES, exactly. The rulebook is clear what to do when there is one isolated tile, it scores as "1". If there is adjacency, it tells you to count all the horizontally adjacent and vertically adjacent tiles, including the placed tile each time. But it does not explicitly say what to do if there is adjacency in one direction and not the other. We have played that if there is any adjacency, then count all the horizontal tiles, then count all the vertical tiles. Since the tile counts itself when there is more than one, it counts itself when there is only 1 (as long as there is more than one along the other axis).

We have occasionally doubted whether it is +1 or +0, but the rulebook is not clear. All the scoring examples that are a single row or column just explain how to sum up in that direction. They not say what to do about the other direction.

We have played as if there are two scoring rules. 1) for an isolated tile, score 1 point. 2) in all other cases, count the number of horizontally adjacent tiles, then all the vertically adjacent tiles, counting the placed tile each time. Many believe there that 2) is: count horizontal only if there are two or more tiles, then count vertical only if there are two or more tiles. Both #2 are plausible based on the scoring rules and examples in the rules.



Tema 468: scoring question
Pregunta:
The game ends after one row in the wall is completed with 5 azulejos
Scoring says that a player gain 2 points for each complete horizontal line.

Not usr if I understand this as the moment one line is filled the game ends ?

Respuesta 1:
The game doesn't end until everyone has finished moving all their tiles in the round that at least one person completed a row.

Multiple players might (and often do) complete a row in that final round, and sometimes a single player might complete multiple rows in that final round.

Respuesta 2:
Finish the full round as normal or moving times and scoring.

At the end of this phase if at least one horizontal has been filled,
then the game is over and you may go to scoring final bonus points.

Respuesta 3:
Adding this quote from the rules for reference purposes (note:"at least one...".

End of the game

The game ends right after the Wall-tiling phase in which at least
one player has completed at least one horizontal line of
5 consecutive tiles on her wall.



Tema 469: Odds of a deluxe version?
Pregunta:
This game wasn't really on my radar, but since it's exploding everywhere, I decided to take a closer look at it. I found out that there are a few items for the game that can be purchased separately, namely:

-resin first player marker(which is included in the new copies?)
-joker tiles
-collector edition tiles, red and blue

So, since the game is so popular, what do you think are the chances that they make a version of the game that includes all of the above and maybe improves the scoring system a bit, so that it is bump proof? Would you be interested in that? Is there something else that you would like to see included?

Respuesta 1:
I'm happy with it as it is. I own the promo tiles but have happily played it 22 times without them and without missing more.

Respuesta 2:
zero chances imho.

the resin first player marker is included in every copy now (if the box has the next move logo it has the first player marker).

the joker tiles were a promo for people who were preordering the game, from what i saw it is a give it or take it. i am not interested because i like the game to be tight. i don't think there is a reason to include it in the base game.

the collector edition tiles are a cool item made for collectors that want different tiles for the back of the board i believe you are suppose to swap one existing color for one of the new tiles, if you want to use them.

the scoring system is perfectly fine unless you want to play with the board on your lap while being on a train or so

all to say that those items are blings, nothing necessary to play, i really don't see a reason to make a deluxe version of the game, the quality is already really really high

Giant edition sounds neat.

But count me as another who has the joker tiles and no longer uses them. They loosen up the game too much. OTOH, if it gets an SDJ nomination (likely) and win (fingers crossed), adding them in a 4th printing/ mass market edition would be good for a more family-friendly game.

Tema 470: [STRATEGIES] Azul - some basic concepts
Pregunta:
[The post was initially published on my boardgames blog HERE]

Today I would like to share with you some observations / strategies which I deem noteworthy when playing Azul. I am not claiming I am professional player in that boardgame but after over~10 games I can share some hints / tricks which played for me.

even after couple of games of Azul, you see that it is very difficult to fill the 4th and 5th row – simply, it sometimes hard to get in one round all that tiles in one color. Thus this is not surprising, that when taking your initial tiles, it is best to take maximum: either three (2) or even four (1) – the latter never happened to me to be quite honest:


while first point is really basic and rudimentary rule for many players, I find much less awareness among Azul gamers for my next proposition: it is obligatory in first four turns to fill always one- and two-tiles rows:

There are to reasons for this: first, you really start to score a lot of points very quickly – see above picture from turn three – 10 points seems like a nice prize. Second, you really control the game then – you decide when it will finish or can easily react when somebody else tries to finish.

last but not least, try to get one particular color set every turn – but not at the expense of strategy point two. Ten additional points at the end of the game is a nice bonus.

And one more thing – not a strategy but a suggestion – play the advanced version. It really gives you much more freedom and is much more interesting then basic one

I mean at least one.

Respuesta 4:
After 100+ games, my experience is more that:

1. Points scored throughout the game can occasionally decide a game, but between experienced players, end game points (columns & sets) is most often what the game hinges on. As mentioned in the OP, the number of points scored during the game escalates wildly as the patterns start to build up, but it's kind of expected of players that they will get some high-scoring placements throughout the game, if they want to be in consideration for victory.

2. Since it's usually easy to see what columns and sets your opponents are going for, hate-drafting in the final turn or turns of the game can sometimes be deciding. E.g., preventing your opponent from taking those last two blue tiles he needs to complete row 4 (where row 4 on the wall is the only row lacking blue) will deny him both the placement points for the blue tile and the 10 points for the set; there's simply so many points resting on this that denying him those tiles can be a game-deciding move. Also, sometimes placement scoring will be so high (8-10 points) that hate-drafting the needed tiles might make sense.

3. Of course, getting rows 1-3 in most turns is nice, and you should try to get those you can if possible. But as mentioned above, you have other considerations. Sometimes, for strategic reasons it's better to place those 3 black tiles in row 5 (even if you don't finish it this turn) instead of completing row 3.

4. It's OK to not finish the longest rows (4 and especially 5) in one turn. Taking say two tiles for row 5 is fine, if you expect to finish it next turn (since already having two tiles will make the job of finishing it next turn that much easier). But think ahead! In turn 4, you don't want to block row 5 with 3 red tiles, if black tiles were what you really needed in turn 5 to complete a column... Also, having half-finished long rows at the start of a turn makes you less flexible when drafting, and more prone to being "trapped" (see below).

5. Which reminds me: Count tiles! Beginners are always surprised when they don't see the tiles they are hoping for in the turn where the bag is emptied. But the information was there for them to see. For example, in a two-player game, don't make your game plan rely on getting lots of blue tiles in turn 5, if a quick count of the tiles already used reveals that not enough are left in the bag... In fact, realize this as early as possible: As soon as the tiles have been placed on the factories for turn 4, realize what's left for turn 5 and make your plan based on that.

6. Since tiles which appear in greater numbers at the beginning of the game will be rarer in later turns, prioritize getting those tiles early on. So, in turn 1 you can choose between starting with 3 blue or 3 red, but red tiles are present in greater numbers overall in the factory circles, all other things being equal, prioritize getting red over blue.

7. A bit trivial I know, but as mentioned above: Beware of "traps"! Being forced to take 7 black at the end of the turn with no room for them will often lose you the game. So plan ahead and act accordingly, so you don't end up in that situation.

8. And another triviality: When drafting X tiles, don't just place them in row X. So, in a two-player game, if there's a factory circle with 3 light blue, but also *two* other circles with 2 light blue each, in this case you can take the 3 light blue and place them in row 5, since you're guaranteed at least one of the other two light blue sets as well. But at the same time, try not to be in a situation where there are too many sets of tiles you absolutely need to finish something, since that makes you a lot less flexible when drafting. Also, keep in mind that sets of tiles on the factory circles will be consolidated in the center, and especially in games with more players, that might happen a lot faster than you expect: You might rest easy seeing that the final black tile you need for a row is resting comfortably in a factory circle, and no one else is likely to take it, but suddenly that tile is now part of a set of 4 black tiles in the center, and your prospects now look a lot bleaker.

9. And finally, a personal preference: My regular opponent and I have actually gone back to playing mostly on the "basic" board. The advanced board is fun at first (it has a few traps of its own), but with more experience, it simply becomes an easier board to play on, and we actually prefer the added restrictions from the basic board.

There's something to be said for that. However, if it was simply the case that most tiles placed wins then you'd just be aiming to fill rows 1, 2 and 3 every round as a minimum (which is usually straightforward) and finish the game with a minimum of 15 tiles placed.

I presume that the bonuses for finishing a column or a set are designed to balance the extra tile cost of the lower rows and that you'll be placing less tiles in your grid. However, my feeling is that the set bonus doesn't outweigh the difficulty of obtaining it. In a 2 player game that lasts 5 rounds (which when I play has always been the case). You need to draft 15 of the 20 tiles of one colour, with no wasted tiles, to complete a set. Your opponent only has to draft 6 tiles of that colour to guarantee preventing you from getting the set.

But that's part of what I love about this game.

The 2-player game plays very differently than the 4-player game. Strategies are different when there are 5 factories of tiles to choose from vs 9.

Basically, can you select tiles that you cannot place?

Is the game playable still with a missing tile, especially at the highest player count of 4?
Simple but aesthetically displeasing solution:

if you're just missing a single tile, you could use something like a die (showing "1") as the first-player tile and use the first-player tile as a replacement for the missing tile.

Slightly less simple and mathematically displeasing solution:

My copy is missing a blue tile. What I do is make a bag of 19 tiles of each color, by setting aside one tile of each color except blue.

When someone discards a blue tile—this has always happened in round 1 so far—I put one tile of each color back in the bag.

This causes each color to be evenly represented at all times. Since you're drawing without replacement, the distribution of tiles in factory displays is not exactly the same as if you had 20 tiles, but at least it's color-symmetric.

I've only played 2-player games, and they've all ended after round 5.

I guess with larger player counts or in longer 2-player games, whenever you put all the tiles back in the bag, you should once again leave out one tile of each color except the missing one, then add them back along with a tile of the short color once you have one of each color in the discard pile.

The only situation I can think of where it'll really bite you is in a 4-player game: there, you have four 5x5 boards, so there's room for 20 tiles of a single color on the player boards. If there's a color you only have 19 of, certain reachable game states can't be represented with the components you have.

The closer you get to this situation, the greater the difference between the probabilities-as-designed and the probabilities generated by this workaround (I think, I haven't done the math).

In a 3-player game, if you have 12 black tiles on the players' 5x5 boards, you'll have 7 tiles left (instead of 8) with which the last black rows can be completed, i.e. you'll be down by 12.5%.

Respuesta 14:
Remove one of each other color from the game as well perhaps?

Note how the word "one" is bolded in this sentence fragment quoted from page 3.

Then, add the tiles you picked to one of the 5 pattern lines on your player board ...


plus this quote as reinforcement.

• Once all spaces of a pattern line are
filled, that line is considered complete. If you have picked up
more tiles than you can place in your chosen pattern line, you
must place the excess tiles in the floor line (see Floor line).



Tema 477: Playing Azul with young children – one simple house rule to make it work
Pregunta:
Azul is a great family game that can be played with children even younger than recommended. We are currently playing this game with our 5 and 7 years-old daughters, and it works fine. We added one simple house rule to make it work:
"Children don't lose points for tiles in their floor line (but adults do as usual)."


This house rule offers various advantages:

First and foremost, your children can focus on completing their pattern lines, without having to mind overdrawing. They can always pick the colour they want.

Second, they will get the first player token more often, as they don't suffer disadvantages from taking it. This will give them a slight advantage.

Third, children really dislike losing points, much more than adults. It can even ruin their game experience. Hence, this house rule will let them experience the game more positive.

And last but not least, the game will be more challenging for the adults. In fact, we don't have to intentionally do mistakes/bad turns to let our children win. In about half of our games, one of our children wins (even our youngest daughter), even if we adults play this game full competitive. We sometimes point out which empty spaces will score them the most points, but that's all help we have to give them.


Of course, you should drop this house rule when your children grow older and start playing the game disruptive (e.g. intentionally forcing other players to overdraw).

I’ve also thought about houseruling that if you do get a tile on The floor instead of losing a point everyone else gets a point. That way it teaches the kids to try not to drop the tiles but also they don’t get the negative effect of losing points and feeling bad about that.

Tema 480: Sword, Board, and Pen Reviews Azul
Pregunta:
Ooooooooh boy. I had been waiting for this game for quite some time after I saw a playthrough on Heavy Cardboard’s YouTube Channel. Unfortunately it was quite hard to find, as it was extremely popular.

Luckily for me, I noticed that it was to be back in stock at Miniature Market, so I quickly jumped over to their corner of the internet, and managed to snag a preorder. It shipped super quick, and since Samantha and I’s game of the week was “Play a New Game” we fired it up with some friends last Friday.

Azul is a tile placement game from Plan B Games/Next Move Games. You are creating a wall inspired by azulejos that can be found across the southern Iberia peninsula. While the theme is nice, to me it’s not vital to the gameplay (although it did make the game more appealing to Samantha).

On your turn you can take 1 color (from 5) of tiles from either a factory space or from the center of the board. You then have to place those tiles on a row (containing 1-5 spaces) on your player board. When you fill up a row, 1 tile goes over to your wall and you score points based upon how many existing tiles it touches. The game is over when someone fills up a row on their wall. The catch is that if you take more of one color than you can fit on a row, the excess falls to the floor, causing you to lose points. There is also end game scoring for the number of rows, columns, and complete sets of colors you have on your wall.

This is a great game. It’s thinky, but not so much that I don’t feel like I can play it after a day of heavy programming at work. It has enough player interaction for us in that you can really screw up someone’s turn/plans if you stick them with enough tiles (at one point during our 1st game I lost 10 points [I think] because I didn’t have anywhere to put them) but if you play completely harsh you will likely won’t win.

The components are fantastic. The player boards are chipboard along with the factory discs, but where the components really shine are the tiles. They aren’t glass, but they feel like a heavier plastic. I am not sure if it’s bakelite, but they are nice to touch and hold while you are thinking about where to play, and there isn’t a seam in them. Additionally, the patterns for the tiles are printed on seamlessly, so I’m not too concerned about it wearing off anytime soon. You also get a nice drawstring bag to keep all the tiles in.

For replayability, there is also a back side to the player board that is just a blank grid (the front side has specific tiles printed on each space in the wall). This is a much more thinky and ‘need to be more aware of what I’m doing’ way to play the game. We haven’t tried it yet, but I am sure we will some day.

For me, Azul is a great gateway game for people interested in more puzzle type games. The rules are not hard to pick up on, but to learn how to play the game optimally will take a few more plays, and can change due to how the tiles are distributed. I really think there is a place for Azul in anyone’s collection, so if you can find a copy for a reasonable price, I’d recommend you grab it!

I actually enjoyed it enough that it displaced one of my 10 x 10 games that we hadn’t started playing yet, so I’m looking forward to playing it more.

No, it was a just a joking reference to the glut of reviews for Fields of Green  due to their promotional offer. There has been a relative boost in Azul reviews, most likely because a lot of people were finally able to get their hands on a copy. I only intended a light-hearted comparison, but one that might have been better received in a forum of users more familiar with the context.

I meant no criticism of the OP, nor discouragement of further Azul reviews.



Tema 481: Thoughts/Reservations on Azul
Pregunta:
You seem fixated on the single pattern, even though you’re fully aware of the reverse side of the board that removes this aspect entirely.

Your entire post makes me think that you’re better off waiting until you’ve played the game first.

Respuesta 1:
I can't tell for sure from reading your post if you've actually played the game or not, but it sounds like you haven't. I strongly suggest you try to do so before making a purchase decision. One game will be enough for you and your girlfriend to decide if the style of interaction is a negative for you or not. In my opinion, it's not a "mean" game. Focusing on denying the other players good moves is typically not a winning strategy. More often, you will have a choice of moves that are equally beneficial to you, but one is definitely worse for your opponent(s), so that's the optimal choice. If that level of interaction bothers you guys, this might not be your game.

As far as having different patterns, the game design really only works with the designs it has. The primary design on the front ensures that all of the end game scoring goals (rows, columns, and designs) are mutually exclusive. The back leaves everything to the player for deeper strategy. Maybe it's just a lack of imagination on my part, but I really don't see how anything in between would work as well.

I've wondered if this was a bit of an oversight. I'll explain:

1) The patterns can't be that varied from board to board. This is because the board intentionally puts the 5 tiles of a color in 5 different columns. This is necessary to maintain balance on any board that might have a unique configuration. This places a huge restriction on how the boards can be arranged and any differences would look minor when compared to the window structures in Sagrada.

2) I still think this minor tweak to player boards would have been a good idea. When playing, I'm inclined to try for colors in the middle column of the board (or at least the middle three columns). This gives me the most flexibility in scoring (more adjacent spaces than there would be on the edges). Since every player has the same middle columns, every player will prioritize the same set of tiles in the first round of every game.

I think it would have been cool to create 5 player boards. Simply shift every column one space to the right (and the last column moves to column 1) to create the next player board. This is a minor change on configuration, but does create unique incentives for the players to start the game.

This is exactly what I was trying to get across in my first post. Even though the game requires certain scoring conditions to be met, and therefore certain arrangements of the patterns, I'm sure there is enough wiggle room to have a slightly different configuration for each of the boards, to at least mix it up a bit. Everyone would then be playing on a slightly different pattern, while still ultimately going for the same main scoring goals. This would seem to give it a more varied feel with each game, and allow each player to pick a board (maybe at random), adding to the feeling of each game being different.
Play on the blank side and do this mentally. This is pretty much how I play the blank side, I decide as I'm playing how the pattern is going to be arranged and start filling it out that way. You've already said they should have shifted this and that, but you can do this on your own.

For example, as I start filling out my board on the blank side, I'll put a red in the top center, then a black below it. Now in the other columns, where ever I put red, I know that black needs to be directly below it. As the pattern builds out, it becomes it's own unique board that automatically follows all the rules.

So you decide the column pattern and fill them out as you go.

As someone who's played almost 10 times, I don't see the single board being an issue. I play (and love) Castles of Burgundy, Kingdom Builder, and Scythe (just to name three very different games) and in those games have different boards greatly adds to the game play. I just don't see it in Azul.

Part of game design and development is figuring out what questions you want the players to ask and answer and then focusing the entire design on that (which is what makes development so difficult and important). In Azul, I believe (my opinion) the questions are about creating limited collections of stuff in a shared space and then taking that stuff to benefit you and deny it to other players.

As far as whether Azul 2-player is mean, I suppose that depends on your definition. 2-player (non-cooperative) by definition is zero-sum so in some sense it is mean. Beyond that, in Burgundy and 'Gric (and even to some extent in Sagrada), at the end of the game players can get a sense of accomplishment, "look at what I've built". For me, that doesn't come through in Azul. At the end of the game, I may get excited about getting a "all-color" or "column" bonus, but I've never looked at my board and thought "oooh! how pretty".

As far as how long it stays in stock/in print, I think it'll depend on if it gets an SDJ nomination/win. If so, it'll probably stick around for at least a few years (though I expect it'll go out of stock multiple times). If not, it may very well end up as a one-year wonder (though, of course, there are a lot of other awards it may win/ haswon).

Obviously the different patterns would all need to be designed to meet similar restrictions to keep the game balanced. I'm pretty sure that pattern is not the only pattern possible to achieve this.
See above. If the boards kept to the same restrictions, you'd essentially just be changing the colours, which are symmetrical (20 tiles of each). It really wouldn't feel any different to play at all.

The blank board is a different issue, because there you are able to change the pattern you are making as the game goes on.

Respuesta 13:
I also think people complaining that two of the tile colors have no pattern are lacking in the fashion department. All those patterns need some solid colors for visual balance. Have you ever seen someone wearing a patterned shirt WITH patterned pants? Not very attractive is it? If every tile had a pattern, that would be visual overload IMO. I see that they are offering a supplementary set of tiles which would make every tile have a pattern. I say yuck.

I also see you can pre-order new blue and red patterned tiles, each separately, of course. I guess that was the plan all along, to include plain tiles so that you would buy the printed tiles later. That would make the game $30 + $12 + $12 plus shipping. $54. Now add in the joker tiles (if you can get them) and the game hits $60 if you're trying to buy everything now. For that, you still only get 1 pattern to play on.

They should have released an expansion with the 2 new sets of tiles, the joker tiles, the 1st player tile, and a new set of boards with new printed patterns, to match the new tiles. That would actually be worth another $25. But $24 just for the extra tiles and no new boards or patterns? And why sell the 2 new sets of tiles separate? They know anybody who is going to order one pattern will want both? So again, why not release it as a proper expansion? This seems like a game that wants to nickel and dime you. Next they will offer a set of new boards, separately of course, for another $15.

We've never had any problem with the score track (after 30 plus plays).

I'm glad we have separate score tracks, rather than one multi people track (as some people suggest) so we can all score up simultaneously.

But look, if you have so many concerns about the game it would seem best not to buy it- there are so many lovely games out there, why contemplate a game that you think has a lot of negatives?

Alternatively try it out with TTR trains or cubes and home made boards, and if you like it, buy it and then you can always look to create your own score track and alternative player boards if you find those things to be a minor issue (but for me, neither thing is an issue, I love the game as it is).

If you're bumping the score track, chances are you're moving your tiles too. Granted, they are heavier, so it may not have as much impact. And if bumping is a real concern, you can now by an (expensive) acrylic cover

I'm not sure that's really a good comparison. All scoring in Sagrada comes at the end. The great part of Azul is that you score every time you add a new tile and a lot of the variability actually comes from the decisions you make around which colors to go for and when

And as for your comment about the collector's tiles, they're meant to replace the blue and red tiles, not add additional sets of tiles. I have a feeling you knew that, but I don't really consider them to be an expansion unless you add them (instead of replacing) for the side of the board with no pattern

Fair enough. I do understand about each pattern appearing only once per row. Personally, I think it would have at least added visual variety if nothing else, and that could break things up a bit by having at least a different pattern to look at when you play, even if game play is essentially the same. I love that in Sagrada there are a number of different patterns you can play on. Of course I understand it's a totally different game mechanic. But what if they only included one pattern in Sagrada?

So you are finally admitting that different boards might not change the gameplay (trust me they won’t) but at least they would add visual variety. But you still want them? You do realize you would be increasing the cost of the game and not adding anything whatsoever to the gameplay? That’s pure nonsense.

As you say yourself, they're totally different games. Sagrada is much more about 'solving' your own puzzle so it adds a variety of puzzles to keep things fresh.

Azul is much more about interaction through the draft (taking things other players want and creating things that other players don't want).

However, I wouldn't call these updated tiles. They aren't. They are tiles designed for big fans that may want to swap their tiles for a different pattern on the back (it doesn't have to be one of the blanks)."

It does seem like they are only playable on the blank side unless you want to be confused. Which is why I also said that if they knew they were going to be releasing new tiles, they certainly should have printed a new set of boards with a new pattern specifically to take advantage of the new tiles. Otherwise, those new tiles are mostly worthless as they can really only be played on the blank side. Instead of a mini-expansion with the new tiles and a new set of boards, they decided to release the new tiles without any new patterns to play on, which is a missed opportunity imo.
Huh, TIL. I was going off of the color and the store page, but you're right that they don't specifically say what they replace. There's even a listed reason for the chosen colors. I stand corrected

Tema 484: Azul with children?
Pregunta:
Has anyone played it with young children? I wonder if rules can be simplified whilst maintaining the puzzle aspect. Maybe only scoring each tile as 1 point?
Also how to make it less cutthroat? Counting broken tiles as -1 only would be one thing I can think of, not sure if it's enough. I don't want it to be another Carcassonne where I feel I need to 'cooperate' with the child or it's too cutthroat, makes it so boring.

Respuesta 1:
We play it with my friend's 7 year old daughter and she does fine. She's very cutthroat sometimes in her drafting. Whether it's intentional or not, I'm not quite sure. We do have to help her figure out what her score is, but that's no different than what I have to do with adults the first few times they play the game.

Respuesta 2:
Thanks! But can you play more or less as if you would with an adult or do you feel you have to tone down the blocking / hate-drafting? Or perhaps with more than 2 it's less of an issue....

Respuesta 3:
My 7 year old has a very good grasp in how to play. He has straight up beaten me a few times and I don't go easy on him.

Respuesta 4:
If you need to simplify it for a first game, I'd suggest maybe making it so that only one of the scoring systems work, and then add in additional system or the rest of them after a few games.

Respuesta 5:
my 9 year old had no problem with the game, after 2-3 plays she even had some of the take that goign on! Occasionally I have to help her with optimal scoring.

Respuesta 6:
Give them the two of the "two block" from the center of the zero (If you didn't throw them away). OR the extra tiles promo.

EXTRA TILES
During set-up each player receives 2 extra tiles and puts them aside as a personal supply. After placing the number tile for the current round, a player may decide to additionally place 1 extra tile from this supply. The usual placement rules apply.

In additional to this. I allow them to place before they place the number and give them 60 points to start. After they can handle the game, place the extra tiles after (because you want them to understand forecast and planning) and reduce the starting bonus points.

FYI, my kid is 6

Respuesta 7:
Got this on Friday, and my 5 and 8 year olds have fallen in love with it. We never considered simplifying the rules, as they're already more straightforward than many others we play.

We have had to offer some minimal strategy guidance to the 5yo, mainly about looking at not just what works best for him, but also what other players might be interested in. While he doesn't always make the best move, he understood the game well enough to play on his own and manage his own scoring after just a couple games.

The 8yo is competitive, and has beaten me more than once. He has surprised me with his ability to plan ahead, e.g. intentionally taking and breaking a single tile on this turn because he realized that not doing so would leave him stuck on his next turn breaking four or five by force.

Respuesta 8:
Thanks everyone, maybe it could work, I like the extra tiles advantage for kids. My daughter is 5.5 and she plays some simpler adult games like Patchwork. I might give this a go.

Respuesta 9:
Another supporter here of playing this with younger players. My boys are 10 and 8 and both took to the game very quickly. They can count the points correctly but we still go around the table one at a time and do our scores so they don’t miss any.

Respuesta 10:
IMHO, Azul is simpler than Patchwork.


Also, my 9 y/o kicks my butt at Azul about 50% of the time, for what its worth.

Respuesta 11:
I posted a house rule for younger children in the following thread: https://www.boardgamegeek.com/thread/1963182/playing-azul-yo...

In short, it's the following rule: "Children don't lose points for tiles in their floor line (but adults do as usual)."

This variant works very well for our 5 and 7 years-old daughters.

Respuesta 13:
So playable yes - winnable difficult for young kids. For Azul Master Chocolatier: We create some custom dice 5 sides have the different chocolates on them and 1 side blank. We roll 2 dice, and whatever it lands on, you can pick up from those factory matts only + the middle or wildcard matts. This introduces a slight element of luck into the game, which stops the adults from always landing their strategy. More variation, and more likely the kids can out on top too.

Jokers we had a small issue with verifying when the shipment will be delivered. So without knowing when and the quantity (we have 2 orders), we decided to move forward without them.

Great question -

I asked the illustrators about why 2 tile designs were left blank. They indicated that players would need somewhere to rest their eyes and the blanks did that. That being said - it's a composition issue.

However, I wouldn't call these updated tiles. They aren't. They are tiles designed for big fans that may want to swap their tiles for a different pattern on the back (it doesn't have to be one of the blanks).

Tema 487: The Future (Tiles) is So Bright, I Gotta Wear Shades
Pregunta:
The full review, including more pictures, can be found on my web site: Dude, Take Your Turn

Don’t we all need a little colour in our lives? Something to make things brighter, lift our spirits?

Did you ever want to lay tile without having to get all of that adhesive ready first?

Azul is the game for you, then!



Azul is an 2-4 player abstract tile-laying game designed by Michael Kiesling with art by Philippe Guérin and Chris Quilliams. It’s published by Plan B Games in North America.

Yes, there is a supposed theme for the game (“Azulejos” were originally white and blue ceramic tiles that the Portuguese king fell in love them with and wanted his palace to be decorated with them, with the players being tile laying artists who are competing to get the job), but let’s face it: it’s an abstract game.

As somebody who doesn’t really do abstract games, what do I think?

Let’s take a look.

How to Play

Depending on the number of players, a number of circular tiles (factory displays) are placed in a circle in the middle of the table. Each player gets a player board with a score track.

There are five types of tiles in various colours and designs, twenty tiles in each design/colour. All are placed in a bag, and then four are drawn for each display.

The first player chooses a display and a tile type, taking all tiles of that type and putting them onto their board. The remaining tiles in that display get pushed to the center of the table.



That player than chooses a row for the tiles they took. They put them into one of the five staging areas on the left side of their board. If the row isn’t filled up (say you took three tiles and you place them in the row with five spaces in the staging area), then you can no longer put any other type of tile in that row until they are gone.

Also, if you take more tiles than will fit in the row (either because there are already tiles there or because you were forced to take more than there are spaces in that row), you put the excess tiles in your floor line (the negative point spaces below your staging area).

Play moves around the table, with players doing the same thing. You can also choose to take all tiles of the same type from the center of the table, but the first player to do that gets a bonus and a penalty.

That player takes the first player marker for next round, but they also place the tile in the leftmost free space of the floor line. Thus, they will get a negative point (or more if the -1 spaces are already filled up) but get to go first next round.

Play continues like this until all of the tiles are off of the table and on player boards.

Once that happens, you look at your staging areas, from top to bottom. If a row in your staging area is full, you move the rightmost tile in the row over to the tile-laying area (the wall) in its corresponding space. You discard the remaining tiles in that row of the staging area.

You then score points for that tile. You first count the number of tiles in the row connected to the tile you just placed (including the tile itself). You then count the number of tiles in the column that are connected to the tile you just placed (including the tile itself). If a tile is all by itself with no connections, then you just get one point.

If the solid blue tile in the very center of the board in the picture above had just been placed, for example, then you would get 3 points for the row and 3 points for the column, for a total of 6 points.

After you’ve done all that, you get your negative points for any tiles in the Floor Line.

Then the next round starts. You keep playing until somebody has completed an entire row on their wall. That will trigger the end game and there won’t be any more rounds.

There is final scoring where you get 2 points for each row completed, 7 points for each column completed, and 10 points if you filled up all the squares of the same type.

Highest score wins!


Is Azul a beautiful mosaic? Or is it a garish bathroom monstrosity?

As I said above, abstract games don’t really do much for me, but Azul is a big exception. I love this game.

It’s such a beautiful game, with components that almost make you want to eat them because they look exactly like Starbursts. But they are a nice, hard plastic that makes them easy to handle and also able to withstand you constantly twisting them around in your hand like poker chips (as I am wont to do).

The player boards and floor displays are nice, sturdy cardboard. They won’t hold up to getting accidentally placed in a clothes washer or anything, but they’re pretty durable.

The game play is really wonderful, too. It’s simple to teach and makes a lot of sense. The only kind of wonky part is the scoring, which is a bit difficult to grasp but after repeated plays will become second nature. It does make sense once you know it, but it’s not the most intuitive aspect of the game.

Until you get that scoring bit, though, some of the strategies may be a bit opaque. Should you try to leave a nice space on the mosaic so that when you place a tile, you can get 8+ points for it? Or do you just start chaining them together in a row, getting one point, then two, then three as you build?

These kinds of strategic choices are what makes the game great. That, and how surprisingly cutthroat it can be, especially at two players.

When you choose tiles to take, you have to take all of that type in the display or the center area. If you know one of your opponents wants the three red tiles in the center because that’s all their row will hold, maybe take something from the floor display so that more red tiles go into the center.

Oops! I didn’t mean to do that. Sorry that kind of screwed you there.



If I didn’t do it, the next guy was going to.

Azul is an abstract game with some bite, but overall it’s pretty simple and easy to teach. Non-gamers shouldn’t have any trouble picking it up after a play or two, and it’s really short (maybe half an hour?).

Thus, it makes the perfect lunchtime game at work if you have up to four players.

Other than the fiddly scoring, I can’t really think of any major criticism for it. If you really don’t like abstract games, then it may not be for you. I would suggest giving it a try, though, just in case you’re like me and find yourself gripped by it.

I highly recommend Azul and would really suggest trying it out.

Whatever you do, though, don’t eat the pieces. No matter how tempting they are.

That’s not good for you and it’s not good for the game.

Trust me. I know.

@clownfeet
literally why would you ever need an overlay for this game? other than "because"?
As garry_rice said, I can see one being useful for the scoring track, since it's really easy for that little cube to get bumped, and it's nigh-impossible after the first couple of rounds (when you're not usually scoring that many points anyway) to reconstruct your scoring. But the main board? If you're playing the A side, there's almost no reason for it other than OCD. I can see it a little bit more for B-side, since the placements aren't pre-set, but since I'm usually teaching the game rather than playing with seasoned players, I have yet to really explore that game space.

Back to the score track, though, if you're finding that your score markers are flying around so often that you're considering that outlay of money, I recommend a free Android app called KeepScore. (I don't know if it exists for iOS as well, but if not, I'm sure there are a plethora of other options.)

Due to warping, the board spun like a top and her score marker and all of her tiles were displaced. We were 3/4 through the game. Luckily, we like the game enough to reset and play again. But that first experience was enough for me to seek our a possible solution.

OK, yes, you're right, my rationale was discounting catastrophic board disruption. But that kind of extreme example could be used to justify a board overlay for anything: Ticket to Ride, Catan, heck, even Checkers. (And I say this as the custodian of two cats who believe that tables should be pristine surfaces, clear of anything and everything from game pieces to drinking glasses.)

literally why would you ever need an overlay for this game? other than "because"?
I purchased the meeple reality ones and can say they are pleasing to use. Biggest issue was fixing the score track from getting bumped but what I didnt expect is how nice it is to drop the tiles into the openings of the acrylic board. It also keeps everything lined up nicely...but then maybe Im crazy because I’m the type that would go as far as to buy acrylic overlays for century spice road...

What some people aren't realizing about the scoring track issue in this game is it's not a matter that the scoring piece can be knocked off it's track easily - tons of games have boards that if you knock the table, the pieces will fall or shift. The problem is in the design of the scoring itself - most of the squares have no numbers, so unless your marker is on a numbered square, you likely won't remember exactly what your score is if it gets shifted. It's mostly just a bunch of small blank squares in rows. That combined with how close all the little boxes are to each other can lead to confusion over where your piece was if you do bump it. It confuses the eye and you don't have numbers to remember which square you were on.

Pete S, how tight is the tolerances of this overlay regarding print alignment on the boards? Of course there can always be a bit of alignment variation from board to board, where the print is shifted just a bit off to one side. I've seen lots of boards that vary a bit in alignment. With all the small rows of score markers and the large tile grids, if a particular board has the printing shifted a bit, I imagine the overlay would not align perfectly and look "off".

Looking at my boards, all 4 are very close to be aligned perfectly centered, with just 1 board being slightly offset vertically by a millimeter or two (the top is slightly shifted higher than the other boards, just a pinch). Would that be enough for the overlay to not line up just right? I know it could still be used, but of course it would look better if everything isn't off a tiny bit.
The overlays align to the art itself quite tightly, as illustrated in the photos below, so the overlays will always look dead-on relative to that. I haven't seen any variation in the art itself.

(apologies for the promo text in the images; they were taken from the product pages)


The location of the printed art on the boards, however, is quite varied, especially between the front and back sides. I would say that variance can be as high as 2-3mm, which is what prevented me from doing the originally-planned corner clips to hold the overlay to the board edges. In cases when the art is shifted substantially, the slots in the overlay will match up to the art perfectly but some edges of the overlay may jut out past the board edge a bit. I considered making the overall size of the overlay a bit less than the board dimensions so there'd be some margin for that, but it looked equally goofy and reduced the structural integrity of the overlay to a level I wasn't comfortable with. In the end I aligned the overlay slots relative to its edges to match the average of the print locations of the normal game art on the four boards I have. I did not factor in the "variant" side of the boards since it differed so substantially from the normal game side.

Hopefully this answers your question but let me know if I'm missing the point. Thanks!

Something else I noticed though - my boards all have a noticeable warp to them - quite a bit. I see this mentioned often in the forums for this game. Enough that the board could actually spin if you're not careful and it's on a smooth surface (another worry for the scoring). I imagine though that the overlay will be awkward to balance on the warped boards, especially with the warp facing upwards, as the overlay will likely wobble.
Yes, warping of the cardboard player boards is definitely an unfortunate thing. I'm not sure if it's an issue more with the first print run since my copy (which I just got two weeks ago) has no problem with that... yet, at least. Unfortunately there isn't much I can do from a design perspective to counter act it. Hopefully there are some techniques out there to help flatten them a bit.

I'll have to weight the pros and cons. It's pretty expensive for everything, for 4 players. I know you priced it as best as you could. Even if I don't go with the overlays, I might go with the factory rings since it's a neat idea to keep them spaced evenly.
Thanks! Yes, I can appreciate the cost isn't cheap. Unfortunately acrylic is an expensive material, and some items take a good bit of time to cut. If it helps at all, the Score Track Overlay now comes with a custom first player marker!



Tema 490: How much will the balance be ruined if used tiles go directly into the bag?
Pregunta:
I played with my family last week and we accidentally put the used tiles directly into the bag. I had played before and thought it was weird that we never ran out of tiles, so I checked the rules after we finished.

But my wife and parents would rather keep playing the wrong way, since it's easier and seemed more intuitive. Will it really mess the game up if we do? I know it means that some colors will be drawn more than others, but will that lead to a ripple effect that will mess things up quite a bit?

Respuesta 1:
Due to the randomness of drawing from the bag, the situation could arise that you take a color into your bottom row of five, needing to complete it in another round and for several rounds, the color never shows up. Is it going to be rare that happens? Yes, but it's also rare that someone in poker gets dealt 4 aces, but it can happen.

As long as you're OK with the rare swings you're potentially going to run into, I don't see much harm. We have a second bag that someone in our game group made to use for the discards. It's really nice because it's sturdy and stands up on the table once it has a couple of tiles in it.

Doing a quick search on google for "Standing Dice Bag" brought back results where you can get one that's very similar to ours, so you can see what I'm talking about.

Respuesta 2:
The cycling guarantees that you'll see 20 of each color in that first run through the bag. By dropping tiles back in, you could end up with colors not making a full showing, so less predictability.

I'd say that it's worthwhile to play as-designed especially as people start to be more competitive in the game, but if you're playing casually I don't know that you'll really notice it unless you get a string of bad luck with a specific color.

Respuesta 3:
Yeah I can't see it being a big deal except in 2p, where in a 5-round game you normally see each tile exactly once.

Respuesta 4:
My question is what does putting them straight back in the bag buy you? Is leaving used tiles out until the bag is empty really enough of a hassle that you'd rather risk increased swinginess of the bag draw?

Respuesta 5:
Why not just use a different bag to capture the end of round discards? This way, you have a ready made draw bag when the starting bag is empty.

Respuesta 6:
It's just that my family got used to it, and my reasons for sticking to the rules weren't persuasive enough. I think we'll go with the 2-bag option or just use bowls without looking.

Thanks for all the replies!

Tema 492: Warped Player Boards

Just picked up a copy last night at my FLGS and was disappointed to see that the player boards were quite warped. This is the printing that comes with the hard plastic 1st player marker so I assume it's the most recent printing.

Your main problem with this will be keeping those lively score marking cubes under control. When they get knocked, you're generally stuffed.

Respuesta 2:
Mine from the 1st printing are warped too. I'm sure I could reverse some or all of the warping by placing them under something heavy for a few days.

Respuesta 3:
There's a degree of 'normal for cardboard' in this type of thing, from your description I assume that you're still in the normal range but feel free to drop a picture if you're thinking it's really strange.

You can leave them out to get normalized to your humidity, throw something heavy on them, see how that works for you.

Personally with this game and many others that have large cardboard elements like this when I take the game out I simply flex them slightly so they lay flat.

Honestly I don't think there's any way to avoid this, you just have to get used to flexing them when you have them out (cause eventually you'll flip them over and play on the backside and have the inverse).

Respuesta 4:
Mine just shipped today from an online purchase. I really hope mine are not warped. A warped board would make it very hard to keep your scoring marker in place I would think and taint the game experience.

Everything you need to play Azul is the cubes/tiles/bricks/whatchamacallit Lay them on the table directly (you don't need the pattern, just like playing on the backside). Consecutive rows on the left are 1-2-3-4-5 squares, everybody knows that. Floor has 2x [-1] 3x [-2] 2x [-3] but if you don't remember you can have just 2x of each as well… And score in the app or just on paper.

Mastery - you can get pretty good after a few plays, but you can never be certain of winning, even against first-time players.
Replayability - I've played amlost 40 times, now, still keen to play more every time.
Player board B - only played once, it made things trickier, and slower (you have to be very careful not to mess over your own board). Still good, but not better.

Respuesta 3:
I've played the game 4 times now (all with 4 players). No wins for me yet but I'm starting to figure out strategies that work and don't work (mostly don't). It's not a particularly deep game but that doesn't mean it isn't going to be fun after a lot of plays. There is a bit of randomness but it really comes down to what the other players are doing, and that really adds to the replayability. Good players have to pay attention to other player's boards and put careful thought into which tiles they take and from where. So far, I have not tried the blank side of the board yet.

This is well said! I clocked my 20th play tonight. I taught two guys. I won one and lost one. You can get better but I think mastery will be hard. There's a lot of strategy but each game will be different because who you are playing and what comes out of the bag. I think you can get good enough to read the other players, get what they are going for, have a plan, and be willing to change it on the fly. But it won't always work. I keep thinking about it, so good!

This game can be as deep as you wanted it to be. You can play it by just looking at your board and what's available at you on your turn and picking the color that give you the most points at that one time.

But you can add another layer by looking at your opponent boards and trying to determine what they need such that you can in your turn pick one color and wait for your next turn to pick the color you "know" your opponents wont take.

And you can add even another layer by tracking the tiles as they leave the boards into the lid and knowing what colors are more available using that bit of information to also inform your play.

It really is just a question of how much information you can keep in your brain running at the same time. At least the player boards and scoring are not hidden.

Petr Dvorak
@satupeka
2. What about the replayability?
In my experience the randomness of the "draw from the bag" and the play position (who goes first, and your relative position to that player) changes this game enough to give it lots of replayability. I have play many times two player and am still liking the game two player; and when you add another player to the mix the game feels totally different.

Petr Dvorak
@satupeka
3. Is the player board B allowing deeper play than board A? How is the game play different?
Haven't played it and not even looking to play it. Because you are still limited to only one color per column, and per row; I feel the difficulty increase form that side comes form keeping track that you don't messup and have two of the same color in any one column/row. And I feel the game is challenging enough as it is to add that silliness.

Thank you for replies :-)
1. Not a deep game, until you do side B. Easy to pick up and understand what needs to be done after one play. Therefore there isn't many different strategies. Patterns for what to pick arise fairly quickly. For example, if there is only 5 of one color out there and it is one you need for the bottom row you probably won't get it as someone else will realize it and take at least one of those tiles.

2. People have different definitions of replayability. If it was a modern game Cribbage would probably not be considered replayable these days, yet I play it all the time.

3. B is more complicated in that you have to think further ahead. You have to make sure you don't mess your board up to make it not possible to place a tile which happened to some one in my last game. You also have to look further ahead to make sure you don't get stuck taking tiles you can't use. While you still have to do that in on the A side the consequences can be more severe on the B side.

Thank you guys for sharing your experiences and opinions. I tried the game in the meantime and decided to use only PnP variant (which is quite easy to make with components from other games). It´s quite good but I will invest in something more complex and variable.

Tema 495: Human Azul
Pregunta:
Has anyone tried this yet?

It's fairly simple. You just need 4 regular players, a playing field or car park, 1 steward, a line marking machine, 1 marquee, 105 guests, 100 onesies (20 each of 5 distinct styles), 4 black onesies and 1 grey onesie (marked with a big 1).

The 100 human tiles run around inside the marquee. The blindfolded steward grabs them and puts them out in batches of 4 to join the human 1st player marker in the play area. The players then play as normal, guiding their human tiles onto their pre-marked grids and keeping score with their human cubes. Discarded tiles are corralled outside the marquee until they're ready to be recycled through the marquee and into play again.

So that's all there is to it.

Enjoy. And please post photos.

Tema 498: New Resin First Player Token
Pregunta:
With the latest print run of Azul, the 1st player cardboard token has been replaced with its own resin tile similar to the ones found in the game. To accommodate fans who acquired the first edition of Azul, the new 1st player tile may be ordered on our webstore for free, but shipping charges will apply to the order.
Players may begin ordering the 1st player tile soon. There will be a limit of 1 tile per customer/order. Please avoid emailing us directly - the item will be added to our web store in the near future.

There are also plans to work with local distributors (US: GTS, Canada: Asmodee, UK: Esdevium/Asmodee, France/Belgium: Asmodee France, Germany: Pegasus) to share these tiles with retailers.

And if you do that, you have to charge for them, as people would just buy 30 of them, keep one and sell them. It's not designed for that. They're offering it for free and want as many of the game owners to get one as possible. Not for a handful to order multiple freebies. If you really want to make sure they get it, give them $5 for shipping and then all they have to do it put it in the cart.

I gave a copy to one of my family members for Christmas. I'll be sending them a link and telling them they should totally pick one up if they want it.

Tema 500: Is this game too cutthroat?
Pregunta:
Ok, I know this game is indeed a bit competitive and that "dick" moves are a good strategy now and then, but I wanted to know if frustrating other players plans is paramount to play right.

A bit of background: I tend to play with friends now and then, many coops and some competitive (New Angeles, Forbidden Stars, Chaos in the Old World), but my main gaming partner is my girlfriend. We love coops and have a good array of them. However, we started with some euros like Puerto Rico, Agricola and Caylus, and she didn't enjoy the level of competitiveness in those games: is not obvious and you have to be mean in subtle ways to mess each others plans. Actually, they were a bit too involved as well for me. We both understood how those games worked, we just didn't enjoy them too much, for different reasons. By the way, traded Carcassonne away years ago because I found that messing with her castles was the right move in most cases and she didn't like to have her plans thwarted like that (I come from MTG background, thwarting my opponents was second nature to me).

Recently I bought Bärenpark and Queendomino and they were a huge hit for us! Not too long, fun and the level of interaction is just right for our taste (pick something the other wants, burn a building too profitable for the opponent, period).

Taking all this in consideration, I was thinking of adding an abstract to our collection, but an appealing one. Azul, Photosynthesis and Santorini all catched my attention, but I don't want to find out that the best strategy involves picking on opponents more than... let's say 10% of my time (does this make sense?).

Anyway, do you think any of those 3 games would be suitable for us or would you recommend something entirely different?

Respuesta 1:
didn't play santorini, so dunno about that

but azul to me feels quite "peaceful" if you play at 4p because it is not profitable to hate draft, it becomes a bit easier in a 3p game and it is fundamental in 2p. in a 2p game you are playing both your board and the other player's one, so a good 50% of your move consist in doing a good move for you that messes up the other player instead of doing the best move for you.

photosynthesis i played it only 4p and it was extremely cut throating and mean, in 2p it may be a bit more peaceful since the board is more open, but putting a shadow over the opponent's tree will remain a good move.

  is a really good 2p abstract with different levels of complexity, but it involves attacking the other player directly. i don't think it is so cut throating, but it is confrontational, so you have to decide on that

  may be a good option, we enjoy it a lot at 2p and the only direct interaction is about completing the objectives first.

  is another game that may work for the situation.

the last thing i will say is that if you are looking for a pretty game that plays well with two i would suggest you  . it is lighter than agricola and it feels much more peaceful, the grande worker makes blocking much less heavy and the game is amazing. And if at some point you want an heavier/more engaging version of it the expansion changes the board

I've already looked into Century, but since it ressembles Splendor so much (from what I've read), I thought on passing (we own Splendor, but we find it too mechanical). Is it really that similar? Any better?

I've been thinking about getting Viticulture ED for a long time, since I saw it played in a gaming club. Really loved it, but was hesitant due to the price tag. I'll consider it again for my wishlist.

Respuesta 6:
Azul is one of my all time favourite games because it can be as cutthroat as you want it to be.

Santorini isn't cutthroat as such but it is one of those abstract puzzles where you are trying to put yourself in a position where you can’t lose, whilst simultaneously trying to block your opponent doing the same.

Not played Photosynthesis.

Your wife will love it until you force her to take 4 tiles she can't place at the end of a round, at which point those nice chunky tiles will be flying across the table at you.

IMO when played optimally all 3 of Azul, Photosynthesis  and Santorini  are cutthroat at 2p. I think most are that way, but here are some ideas:

Dimension  - if you don't mind realtime, there is absolutely no conflict in this because each player has her own board.
Favor of the Pharaoh  - if you aren't allergic to dice, this is a fun dice manipulation and set collection game. I don't think dice are allowed in the traditional abstract club, but the theme is very pasted-on and the mechanism are quite simple so it feels abstract to me.
Qwirkle  - instead of blocking, you try not to put down the second to last piece of a "Qwirkle" which would enable your opponent to complete the Qwirkle if she has the right tile.

Here are some non-abstract but simple(r) games where you can build your stuff without worrying that your opponent will knock it down, or if there is blocking it's (almost) entirely incidental instead of strategic:

Akrotiri  - very rarely can you figure out what end-game goal your opponent is going for and block her
Avenue  / Kodama  - zero conflict
Century: Spice Road  - picking cards other players might want, usually by accident
Kanagawa  - competition in drafting and racing for objectives
Karuba  - racing for objectives
Paperback 
Port Royal  - you can hate draft but there's almost always something that will be better for you instead of drafting just to deny other players
Qwixx  / Rolling America  / Noch mal!  / etc. - practically zero conflict. You can gamer it by looking around to see what the worst thing will be for other players (Qwixx) but that's seldom good for you either.
Red7  - an argument could be made for this being confrontational, but mostly I find you're trying to make the best of the cards you have.

That's exactly what I want to avoid. I know I can restrain myself and not mess with others plans, but not when I know that's the best move I can do. I hate being a dick for the sake of it, but I also hate underplaying when I know the game lets me do better. Likewise, I don't like to alphaplay in coops, but I won't refrain from pointing out when another player is about to make a bad play.

Sure thing, I'll do. It's just that I had dismissed entirely for that "Splendor killer" tag.

Depends entirely on player count. Game is brutal at 2. Mean at 3. But rarely so at 4.
But in all fairness, that can be said about most games where your move can have a direct impact on another player's play.

In a 2-player game, you have one objective: do better -- by whatever mechanic is relevant in the game, but for the purposes of this example let's use "score more points" -- than the other player. That means that "scoring 3 points" and "costing the other player 3 points" are functionally equivalent(*) moves.

In a 3-or-more-player game, those moves are no longer equivalent, because by scoring points yourself, you're gaining ground on both players, but by denying points to one opponent, you're only gaining ground on that one. (And, in fact, denying yourself points in order to deny a single opponent points is helping the third player.) So "spite play" no longer becomes as effective an option, and even less so as player count increases.

(*) not taking into account, of course, the ramifications of those moves, what further moves they influence, etc. The model can only get so complex here, folks.

Respuesta 15:
My wife has not been an enthusiastic gamer. That said, she immediately took to Azul. I was surprised when I taught her and she wanted to play again, not one more time, but 4! And more since that night.

Now, a caveat. I will, especially when teaching, make a sub-optimal move now and again. I consider it an unspoken handicap as a personal challenge to myself. In the process, my wife learns and has a positive experience, devoid of the frustration of feeling like she's stupid.

Each person has their own threshold for adopting new activities. Your job, if you want someone to play more games with you, is to learn what it takes. People who are willing to learn one game can shift on the scale from non-gamer to casual gamer, and so on. You just need to discover the best way to go about cultivating their interest and enjoyment in playing games together.

Certainly, game selection matters. I think Azul can be a perfectly pleasant option. Santorini  is not unlike chess in a way, so consider her feelings on similar abstracts.

For other casual (not all necessarily abstract) recommendations for 2 players?
(The aMAZEing) Labyrinth  - spatial movement and set collection
Blokus  - Tetris-style area control
Carcassonne  - tiles-laying appeals to puzzle fans; almost never use the Farmer when teaching
Junk Art  - multiple games to choose from: competitive, co-op, and creative
Kodama: The Tree Spirits  - unique drafting and laying; minimal interaction through open drafting
Rise of Augustus  - gamer bingo! with a light worker placement and set collection; great card art
Tsuro  - spatial mapping tile placement; scales well to more players

Respuesta 16:
It is true that ina a 2player game the competition is direct, but in Carcassonne you are denying the other the possibility of finishing castles, ergo, completing their goals, meanwhile in Queendomino you are taking the tile that suits the other best, but he/she can still keep playing, but scoring less. That's what makes a game cutthroat or not for me

There's some philosophical argument that many competitive games can be played cooperatively or magnanimously if all players agree to it. I've played Carcassonne with my daughter where we agreed to make only helpful placements. It's a house rule, essentially, but if you want a game that has little to no "take that" out of the box, you're denying yourself some opportunities.

Because if you don't force the play, you can just play every game till your entire board is full. Not only do I prefer that kind of up front puzzle solving, but in a co-op situation, giving a team mate a decision point that can lead to that much of a gamble of points can be unsatisfying.

If Vibagon is playing with his girlfriend, and they prefer co-op games over competitive ones, Azul is an easy game to tweak to co-op instead of competitive.

Respuesta 24:
2 games which I haven't seen mentioned here :
1) Take it to the Limit (quite old game) more of puzzle solving, but so is Azul.
2) Codenames, with a little rule modification,can also be played as coop with 2 players.
Pkayed that way, both are amazingly peaceful.

Can you open this a bit? I didn’t understand. Thank you.

Respuesta 4:
Count the number of "horizontal points" the tile gets from it and all touching tiles in a consecutive horizontal run from the one placed.

Count the number of "vertical points" for the same thing vertically.

You get credit for the horizontal points if they are at least 2. You don't get anything from horizontal scoring if it's only 1.

You get credit for the vertical points if they are at least 2. You don't get anything from vertical scoring if it's only 1.

No matter what, you always get at least 1 point.

So the first black tile gets 2 horizontal points for 2. The vertical points would be only 1 so do not count. 2 Points for black.

The red gets 2 horizontal points for 2. The vertical points for the red placement are also 2. 2 + 2 = 4.

When it is time for yellow, that's 4 vertical points. Horizontal does not score because it would be only 1 horizontal point so the yellow placement will be 4 more.

Respuesta 5:
Maybe we are playing it wrong, but I thought:
- 4 points for black, horizontally adjacent to blue/white (2 points), verticale adjacent to red (2 points)
- 4 points for red
- 4 points for yellow

For a Total of 12 points.

Or am I missing something.

Respuesta 6:
You are. The red is not there when the black tile was placed so at that moment black does not get any credit for vertical points. You place tiles top down and score each one immediately after placement.

First three tiles are worth 6 points, and I also had the starting player (-1) tile.

Yes. Tiles must be installed one at a time from top to bottom. So scoring on the previous turn would be..
Blue 1pt
Black 2pts

Tema 502: A side or B side plus joker tiles
Pregunta:
after 25 games of the A side we tried out the B side the other day. Have to say, i really enjoyed it! at first you think you'll just do the same pattern as normal but then you realise that its better to fit things in as they come out.

Scores were around the same but it increased the "thinkiness" of the game for sure.

we shall be playing with B sides from now on.

We don't like the joker tiles at all. We just use one of them as the Start player

Respuesta 1:
i mean, they're ok. but i think we just like our games a bit meaner and tighter.

we're not fans of anything that gives you an "out". You made a suboptimal move/mistake?...plan better!

Respuesta 2:
We have actually started going back to the A side, after playing on the B side for a lot of games.

The B side holds a few traps for the unwary, but with care it is simply a more flexible side to play on. We have found that when playing on the B side, we tend to fall back to using the same strategies in most games (prioritizing column-building). The A side, in contrast, doesn't give us as much freedom, and we often find it more interesting to play with the additional restrictions imposed by the A side.

(This after about 100 games, most of them 2-player).

Respuesta 3:
In games I've played (on side A), most players try to avoid the Joker tiles as it kills the opportunity to score 10 points for placing all 5 of a color.

The B side makes the games thinkier as if you are not careful, you could have an impossible placement, as you cannot repeat colors within a row or column. The joker tiles do make this a bit more forgiving though as joker tiles can repeat.

The part about "...except that... you may place it on any space..." and then the emphasis on "vertical" with no mention of "horizontal" led us to believe that on the B-side you could duplicate colors within rows.

We may have played that wrong, but I can see/read/understand the rules both ways now. In any case, duplicating colors in rows, but not in columns, made for an interesting game.

The rules for the B side are the same as the A side, (as it says in the second sentence) - so you can't have two tiles of the same colour in a row or column.

This has been confirmed by Plan B (but I couldn't find a link to this, sorry). I agree the wording in the rules is not ideal, and could be misleading - if I remember correctly they were going to address this in subsequent rules.

in mind that in each horizontal line, no color may appear more

Special case: In the wall-tiling phase, it may happen that you are
not able to move the rightmost tile of a certain pattern line over
to the wall because there is no valid space left for it. In this case,
you must immediately place all tiles of that pattern line in your
floor line (see Floor line).

Not repeating horizontally is already a rule in the basic game so isn't listed as part of the additional rules. It still applies though.

We all saw that the Variant provided an exception (that stuff after the word, "except") that specified a new rule for both rows and columns.

Everyone in my group read it the same way, and our understanding did make for an interesting game. You may wish to try this "variant" to the Variant to see how you like it - allowing duplicates in Rows, but not in Columns.

Tema 503: Shout Out to Mike and Plan B Games
Pregunta:
Today I received my copy of Azul. I was pretty pleased to be getting this beautiful game. However my excitement soon turned to disappointment when it became apparent checking the tiles I was one short, a black one.

I’d read on a Facebook group I belong to that someone had trouble getting a replacement. So I covered all my bases and emailed customer service and left them a polite message on Plan B Games’ page on Facebook.

Less than 2 hours later I was contacted by the CEO no less, Sophie Gravel. Not only did she say don’t worry we will sort this for you today she also apologised. Not long after I was contacted by Mike via FB messenger and email, who took my details and has dispatched the missing component - within hours! Mike gave me an ETA. Plus gave me a tip so I could play the game and keep it balanced. Plus he emailed me to confirm and finally gave me some tips of what to look out for and where Plan B Games are headed this year.

Wow! My hesitation as far as customer service from Plan B Games were totally unfounded. It was stellar and as far as I’m concerned one of the best customer experiences from any publisher to date. I can not fault it. I really can’t. Plan B Games are doing it right. They are utilising social media effectively and using multiple points of contact and doing it fast.

No complaints at all even though my game was missing a component and that was disspaointing, their prompt and customer focused attention made it all ok. I’d be happy to buy another game from them any day.

Tema 505: REVIEW: Azul


Tema 506: Azul: A Thorough Review - Roll to Review
Pregunta:
If you’re like me and thought all board games are abstract, well, you’re both right and wrong. The term abstract game is now a genre term that reasonably means the game contains minimal luck, usually two players, and little to no theme. Think of Chess and Checkers as prime examples of abstracts, or more recently Azul. A 2-4 player abstract game designed by Michael Kiesling and published by Plan B games.

In this game players put on their overalls and travel back in time to build a fabulous new wall for the King of Portugal. That was me squeezing all the thematic juice out of Azul. Instead of an entertaining or thoughtfully storied experience this board game opted for complex, yet arbitrary scoring system that determines a winner by skill, intelligence, and masonry. Was it worth the sacrifice? Let’s find out.

How to Play
For setup, everyone gets a player board, a score marker, and then several (depending on player count) four-tile piles are placed in a circle around the middle of the table, these piles are referred to as factories. Between these factories, is a middle factory that has tiles added to it during play, the first player marker is placed in this middle factory – which I’ve lovingly named the trash factory.

The player board is where most of the game takes place. On the left side, it has five steps borrowed from the end of a Super Mario level - each step is known as a pattern line, a 5x5 grid on the right which is called the wall, and one final row at the bottom of the board named the floor line.

On a turn, a player picks up every tile of one colour from any of the factories, trash factory included. If the player chose an orbiting factory, then they smile with style while the other defiled tiles, file into the vile tile exile – aka the trash factory. Otherwise, the first player to grab tiles from the trash factory also grabs the first player token, placing it on their floor line.

The collected tiles are then added to a pattern line following these conditions:

* At any moment, a pattern line can only hold one colour of tile.
* The tiles collected are added to a pattern line from right to left.
* Any tiles that don’t fit on the pattern line fall onto the floor line.
* If a wall already has a tile, then tiles of that colour cannot be added to corresponding pattern line.
* Collected tiles may be placed directly onto the floor line despite having open pattern lines.

After all the tiles have been picked up, the building and scoring phase takes place. In this phase, you take the right most tile of each completed pattern line and add it to the wall, removing the remaining tiles on the pattern line from the game. You score the tile by either getting one point, if there are no other tiles connected to it, or by getting points for itself and how many tiles it connects with in a line horizontally, vertically, or both. Lastly, you take increasing penalty points for every tile on the floor line.

The factories are then refilled and play resumes with the person who last picked up the first player token. This continues until the end of a round where a player completes a horizontal row. Then after-game scoring kicks in, and players get points for completed rows, completed columns, and completed sets of the same colour tile.

The Good
The great thing about Azul being an abstract game is that I don’t need to tell you how good it looks on the table. Or how the beautiful resin tiles crackle when you shuffle them in the soft cloth bag. Or how the setup only takes seconds. Or how easy it is pick up the rules. Or the consistent feeling of building and accomplishment you get from filling up pattern lines and adding tiles to your wall. No, I don’t need to tell you any of that, because we need to talk about the core of this game: strategy.

The first thing you need to understand about Azul is that there is a variable end condition, the game can end at any moment after five rounds. This means you must plan on leading at the end of the fifth round or be able to stop an opponent from ending the game.

Combined with after-game scoring it creates a fantastic balance of both short and long-term objectives. In the short term, you’re trying to keep your score total above your opponents, but to maximise points in the long term you need to line up columns and get specific tiles to complete sets. Once you understand this, you realise the falsehood of the empty grid at the start of the game. It promises you the freedom to do what you want, when in reality you need to choose which colours and columns to focus on from the very start. That’s if you want any chance of completing these longer-term goals.

The long-term objective of getting a set of one colour isn’t all it seems either. The more you fill the wall with one colour, the harder it becomes to place that colour, as it can only be used in specific spots. The longer the game goes on, finding and filling lines correctly becomes increasingly difficult.

That’s the overall strategy and it's easy to focus on when you’re not playing, however the decision-making process on a turn to turn basis isn’t that straight forward. There’s a lot more going on. For instance, you need to think about the economy of tiles. You’re often faced with the choice of waiting for tiles to fall into the trash factory or use a few turns to grab the tiles from the surrounding factories. A third option may be a lot of tiles of a single colour in the centre that isn't immediately of use but could cheaply fill up some of your longer rows.

Another tough decision is measuring the worth of completing rows of unwanted colours by end of the round, against getting tiles and completing rows of the colours you want. Having leftovers from previous rounds can be extremely damaging. They will block you from adding new colours to your board, leaving you with a lot of tiles, and nowhere to put them.

Now let me introduce you to your opponent: a human sized spanner ready to jump into your works. On top of everything else, this board game is about blocking and stealing tiles and forcing your opponents into bad pick-ups, saddling them with as many unusable tiles as possible.

It’s beautiful isn’t it? You’ve just read six paragraphs about a single decision: which colour tile should you pick up? It’s strategy equivalent of cramming Smithers onto the Spruce Moose, and for this my hat is off to the designer.

The Bad
I’ve mentioned it above, but one of the things that may put people off Azul is how mean it can be. Not only is blocking a core mechanic, but the board game also uses negative points. Anytime a game takes away player progression it better be for a good reason, otherwise there’s significant psychological ramifications: it makes players feel bad. Being an abstract game Azul doesn’t have a good reason for this negativity. Furthermore, a player is usually not doing well when they receive these points, so a lot of the time it's just adding insult to injury.

On the topic of psychology, there’s a weird effect in Azul where I felt myself unconsciously go for the tiles I deemed prettier, even if the move was detrimental to me. With enough plays I’m sure I’d grow out of this, but nevertheless it’s an interesting and unusual phenomenon that impacted how I performed.

Another minor issue is how the tiles are scored. If it’s not connected to anything or only connected to a row or column then you only count the placed tile once. However, when it’s connected to both a row and a column, you count the placed tile twice. This small but subtle difference isn’t exactly intuitive, and players can get confused. The problem is compounded by players usually doing their own scoring in private, making it hard to pick up if scoring is done incorrectly.

The more players in the game, the worse it becomes. More people picking up tiles and impacting the board state between your turns, increases the difficulty of planning and makes the game feel more random. Conversely you have less of an impact on the board state, as there are more tiles for everyone to pick from, therefore blocking has less importance, also blocking one person allows the other non-blocked players to gain an advantage. In turn, this makes the game less strategic, as it’s impossible to keep track of other players moves and motives.

Still sticking with four players, there is also an issue with unwanted tiles. If there’s one type of tile that no one wants it just builds up in the trash factory. This creates a horrible lottery at the end of the round where one player is forced into picking up eight or more tiles, usually leading to many, many negative points, knocking them out of the contest.

The Verdict
This game put a spell on me. I found myself often getting lost trying to figure out my best move. I hated it for that, but I also loved it. I love that it engages me so completely that I feel like I know how the sailors felt falling for the siren’s song.

Azul is the best tile laying game since Carcassonne, it's incredible, and incredibly accessible. It’s easy to learn rules – when using visuals – belie its depth and decision space. It loses some edge when playing with more people, and it does have some meanness which could put some people off. Personally, I found it refreshing, it’s not something I want in every game, but I thought it worked well here. I’m giving this game my famous Critical Hit rating, meaning that you should check it out. Now, for some reason, I have an urge to re-tile my bathroom.

I explained the scoring as Scrabble scoring. Works the same way and a lot of people understand that reference. Clicks pretty quick after that.

Respuesta 2:
At first I wondered why people considered this game best at 2 players, but as I've played it more (25+ times now), I've become more proficient at the game and realized that the chaos in 3 and especially 4 player games an be frustrating. I still love it, but it's a bit more of a tactical experience.

Respuesta 3:
Like most abstract games, people want to over think this game. Game play time should honestly only take 8-12min per player, making this an excellent filler. The box time of 30-45min reflects this sentiment. If you play in this time frame, even with 3-4 players, the game is incredibly fulfilling and the negative points aspect isn't a real problem. When people sit and study the board for that perfect move however, a light, beautiful, abstract, tile-laying game becomes a punishing slog of an experience that will turn off most players.

Tema 507: [Top of the Table] Azul's Fresh Take on "Tile Placement"
Pregunta:
If you’ve been following my blog for a while, you’re probably aware that I love games that push boundaries. Well, Azul does just that, offering a fresh new take on tile placement games. Rather than using the classic mechanic as simply a means to an end, the designers have asked a poignant question: why can’t laying tiles be a goal, in and of itself?

Mind. Blown.

In honor of this groundbreaking game, I’ve come up with a list of six new game ideas inspired by popular game mechanics:

1) Staffing, Inc. – A hand management game about worker placement.
2) Kleptomaniacs – A worker placement game about hand management.
3) Mutant Sports League – A campaign style game about variable player powers.
4) Pantsuits and Hairpieces – A variable player power game about campaign style.
5) Hazmat Cleanup Site – A deck building game about area control.
6) Contractor Wars – An area control game about deck building.

I hope you enjoyed that list, and if it inspired you to come up with any new game ideas of your own, please feel free to share them in the comments below. For now though, let’s get to the overview & review.

An Overview in Blue

The game of Azul, known simply as “Blue” in England, is quite easy to learn. The goal is to lay five colors of tiles in a 5×5 mosaic grid, scoring points for strategic placement.

Each time a player pays the requisite cost to place a tile in their grid, they score a point. The base scoring increases when players manage to string multiple tiles together in a row or column. Additionally, players can earn big bonuses for goals such as obtaining five tiles of one color or completing a vertical column.

How do players pay for these tiles, you ask? In a shocking twist, tiles are bought with… tiles. To place a tile in the first row, you must pay one tile (seems fair), but to place a tile in the fifth row, the cost is five tiles of that color. Those tile-laying unions are brutal, man.



So why would you ever want to place a tile in the fifth row? Well, to score more points, of course. Also partially because you can often find yourself in a situation where you’ve got more tiles than you know what to do with.

You see, each round there are a bunch of ‘suppliers’ with four tiles each. Players take turns going to a supplier, taking all the tiles of one color for free and placing any other tiles into the central market square. So basically you’re robbing these tile merchants blind and then realizing you took more than you can even carry. Blame the crazy fluctuating exchange rates – how else is a tile layer supposed to make a living out here?!



As an alternative, players can choose to grab all the tiles of one color from the market square. This can be a gold mine, especially after many of the suppliers have been raided. But…. there’s a catch.

If you ever take more tiles than you can fit in a payment row, then you drop the excess tiles on the ground. And you get negative points for every tile you have to drop, because that’s just wasteful.



The first person to take tiles from the market square gets to go first next round. But they also get a negative point. Because patience is a central virtue to all tile layers.

As soon as one player completes a single row of tiles, the game ends and the final scores are tallied. Scratch what I said about patience, I suppose.

My Thoughts on Azul

There’s a lot to like about Azul. I’d place it in the same camp as Patchwork, as a game that is quick and light enough to be a game night appetizer, but still packs enough strategic depth to offer a satisfying challenge. It may look simple on its face, but there are many strategic avenues to pursue without a single dominant path to victory. And there’s just the right amount of player interaction — other players’ choices definitely have an impact, but without generally having a ‘take that’ kind of feel.

What’s more, while Patchwork is only for two players, Azul ranges up to four players. BoardGameGeek’s data suggests that most people like it best with two, but I also thoroughly enjoyed it with the full count of four.

In terms of areas for improvement, I wish Azul didn’t come in such a big box. It seems like a prime candidate to be a great travel game, but it comes in the same size box as much heavier games. I’m sure this is due to market forces (mass-market appeal of ‘standard-sized’ board game boxes, demand for top-quality components), but it just feels… excessive.



With smaller tiles (maybe even using cardboard instead, dare I say it?) and condensed player boards, the publishers could easily get Azul down to the same box size as Patchwork. I’ve heard that they’ve made a Giant Azul for showing off at conventions, so maybe a Mini Azul isn’t out of the question!

That being said, if you are a sucker for premium quality components, Azul will not disappoint. From the thick player boards to the feel of the tiles to the beautiful tile bag, the publisher pulled out all the stops on this one.



Despite my preference that it came in a smaller box, I do feel that Azul is definitely worth checking out. Whether it’s a game worthy of adding to your collection will depend on how much room you have on your shelf for lighter weight abstract games. However, I do feel that this fantastic design is deserving of its current spot in the BoardGameGeek Top 100.

My only other gripe about Azul is that I feel like the static layout of the mosaic grid may somewhat limit the amount of replay value. Taking a cue from Castles of Burgundy, it would have been interesting to have a few different layouts to choose from for your player mat. Even just eight individual options could yield a ton of potential combinations to explore.
So, opportunities for expansions, then!

That's what the opposite side of the board is for! It's much more open and flexible. The downside is that you and your opponents have so many more options meaning games take a little longer and it's more difficult to play against your opponents because it's not as easy to 'see' what they want and need.

The other side of the board has the unfixed layout. You just have to obey the rule that you can never place a tile in the same column or same row as a tile of the same colour. Then you aren't stuck with simple diagonal spacing of the tiles!

Tema 508: Azul - A Dutch Review
Pregunta:
Op Spiel 2017 was Azul enorm populair. Aangezien het niet lukte om een tafeltje te bemachtigen tijdens de 3 dagen dat ik op Spiel was, heb ik deze maar blind gekocht voordat de voorraad helemaal op was. Inmiddels heb ik het spel een aantal keer kunnen spelen. Voldoet het aan de hoge verwachtingen?

Azul is een abstract spel van Michael Kiesling voor 2-4 spelers, waarbij eenieder probeert een mooie tegelvloer te maken voor de Portugese koning. Uitleg en klaarzetten duurt slechts een paar minuten, het spel zelf duurt ongeveer een half uurtje. De componenten, en dan met name de tegels zijn van hoge kwaliteit en lekker dik, deze nodigen echt uit om te spelen. De spelersborden zien er prima uit. Spelregels zijn lekker kort en voorzien van duidelijke voorbeelden.

Iedere ronde bestaat uit 3 fases:
Voorbereiding
Iedere ronde begint met het vullen van een aantal marktkramen met tegels. Het aantal kramen is afhankelijk van het aantal spelers (aantal x 2 + 1) en op iedere kraam liggen exact 4 tegels die blind uit een zak worden getrokken. Deze tegels hebben 5 kleuren en deze corresponderen met de kleuren die op de tegelvloer op je eigen tableau. Deze tegelvloer probeer je tijdens het spel te vullen, wat je roempunten oplevert.

Tegels kopen
Vervolgens, beginnend bij de startspeler, kies je ofwel voor alle tegels van 1 kleur van 1 kraam ofwel alle tegels van 1 kleur in het midden van de tafel. Deze tegels die je hebt gekozen plaats je vervolgens op je eigen tableau in 1 van de rijen. De overige tegels van deze kraam verhuizen naar het midden. Mocht je meer tegels hebben dan er op de rij geplaatst kunnen worden, dan komen de overige tegels in de onderste rij te liggen, deze leveren je strafpunten op. Dit gaat zo door totdat alle tegels verdeeld zijn. De eerste speler die uit het midden tegels koopt, krijg het startspelerfiche dat ook een strafpunt oplevert.

Plaatsen en scoren
Nu vindt het plaatsen van de tegels en het scoren plaats. Als een van de rijen op je tableau vol is, dan mag je 1 van deze tegels plaatsen op je vloer, de rest gaat in de deksel van de speldoos. Je scoort hierbij punten voor de aangrenzende tegels in de rij en kolom naast de geplaatste tegel. Als er niets naast ligt, dan scoort je toch 1 punt. Je probeert dus tegels dicht bij elkaar te plaatsen, zodat je mooie combo’s kunt maken.

Tenslotte wordt er gekeken of iemand een hele rij van zijn tegelvloer vol heeft, want dat triggert het einde van het spel en de toekenning van de bonuspunten: 2 voor iedere volledige rij, 7 voor iedere volledige kolom en 10 voor alle tegels van 1 kleur. Hiermee zijn dus nog aardig wat punten te verdienen.

Conclusie
Azul is een zeer geschikte filler, die de casual gamer zal aanspreken. Het is prima te spelen met kinderen. Mensen die meer uitdaging zoeken kunnen ook met de achterkant van de tableaus spelen.

8,5/10



Tema 509: Extra tiles from the box?
Pregunta:
Hello everyone,

Yesterday, when we were playing the game, we dropped couple of tiles to the ground and to make sure at the end of the game, we counted all the tiles.

We got one extra red tile. All the other ones were 20 each.

Did you guys count the tiles came with the box? Is it all 20 for you?

Thanks

Respuesta 1:
20 of each in my copy. If you have 21 red I would remove one (dunno, paint it and use it as first player marker), cause the fact that colors are balanced is quite important (in 2p game at least, where quite often you see every tile only once, in higher player count it may be less important since you need to reshuffle tiles several times anyway)

Tema 510: Wrong played
Pregunta:
What if you cannot play the tiles?

Excuse me for bad English lanquage....

Ok, I already red in another topic you have to discard the tiles to the row below and get minus points?

What to do in this occation? Only the one tile above to the minus points? Or the 4 red tiles? Can the player choose? Or just start from above and then find out he has to discard the 4 tiles?

We found out while the tiles allready played and when we went to phase 2 and count points.
If the player found out earlier maybe he could discard them for minus points earlier but he - and no other players - nobody did.
Or can the player discard the tiles to the box with no problems?

Respuesta 1:
You bring them over from the top down

So move over the top one, now where can the row of 4 place? they all go to the floor instead since they cannot be placed.

Respuesta 2:
Yup, there's no choice, you work your way down when you're doing scoring, so those four all have to go to the floor.

Kim Williams

With over 100 plays, I think my average score is 85-90. My highest being 125, however I am sure a contrived 2p game implemented to score high by delaying the game could reach 140 (again just to say they did it).

High scores are generally due to playing 6 or more rounds - which can easily be achieved by players agreeing to not complete a row until their wall is nearly full and rows have to be completed.

Most gamers will rush the end - getting a row completed in 5 turns. This makes high scores much more improbable.

So, let's say it was an extremely friendly game with extremely lucky draws (no negative points, no one wants to finish the game way earlier than it could have happened). 46 points come from the endgame scoring (3x10 for the colors, 2x7 for the column and 2 for the row).
I don't think more than ~100 points could be scored during the game when these stones were placed (especially as there is only a single connection between the two halves of the tiled parts). There must have been some extreme miscalculation there.

Ok, we reread the rules and realized we were recounting tiles each round. Sorry for the confusion folks.

Respuesta 17:
So what is the highest mathematically possible score?

I'd assume that players would have to collude such that 1 player takes no negative vp and allows them to fill rows in 1 action and allows them to have a full board.

Respuesta 18:
Filling one column each round gets you 240 but it must be possible to do a bit better than that.

Respuesta 19:
I calculated 246 as highest possible, if you fill one complete column each round, always adjacent to a previously filled column.
First round, 15 points; second round, +24 points; then +29; +34; +39; bonuses 10+35+50.
I might be missing something?

Respuesta 20:
That's 236, and you are right, I slightly miscalculated the top row.

Respuesta 21:
But if you choose another order for tile placement the score might be higher.

Respuesta 22:
That's what I said

Respuesta 23:
In a six round game, my highest score was 134. My second highest score was a distant 104.

Tema 515: Game Etiquite for remaining tiles.
Pregunta:
It feels like you should not be able to look in the bag, but I don't feel as strongly about looking at the tiles in the box, even though it allows you to deduce the tiles that are in the bag.

Do you play that it is okay to look at tiles that have been discarded to the box?

Respuesta 1:
We play that there's no looking in the bag. At any time, knowing that there are 20 of each tile type in the game, it's easy just to count those out on player boards if you need to see what's left. With 2-player games, since we just cycle through the tiles once most of the time if we only go five rounds, we leave the discards on the table. For 3 to 4 player, I added a second bag for discards each round to make refilling easier.

Respuesta 2:
Do you find yourself looking at all the visible tile (in play and discarded) and calculating what tiles are in the bag, or are you are playing a "lighter" version of the game?

I have played the game a few times and knowing what is in the bag seems like an advantage.

Respuesta 3:
I think it's definitely OK to look at what tiles are discarded in the box, but not to ask to look in the bag.

The box is open info. IMO However, if you don't want that knowledge easily accessed, turn the tiles face down. JK

Seriously though, we use a big plastic cup (Big Gulp) or another bag (similar size) to store the used tiles. The cup makes it easier to refill the bag. The second bag becomes the draw bag when needed. Either way, we don't see what's in the cup/bag. I don't think that this game is long (or strategic) enough to need to analyze every possible combination of tiles available. Most games last five or six rounds. If a game lasts more than six rounds it's a rare occasion.

BTW Looking in the bag is definitely off limits. IMO

I only "tile count" what is public knowledge (not what's in the bag) when I'm going for a 10-point end of game color, to make sure it's worth my while to pursue that over finishing a column or whatnot. Not sure what a lighter version of the game looks like. We always play by the regular rules.

What I meant by “lighter” is how much mental energy you are using to play the game.
Some groups I have played games with are more intense than others. The players in those groups know the probability of card/tiles being drawn based on what has been played.
Other groups don’t keep track of what was played as closely and those games seem lighter.

Tema 516: Plastic Score Track Overlays?
Pregunta:
Anyone know if these are in the works anywhere? I feel like Meeple Realty would really do them justice!

Respuesta 1:
I'm sure there is a market for this, but to be honest we've never had any issues yet. I think it was a very smart decision to put the score track ABOVE the play area.

Of course, we've only played 2-player with the factories off the side of our boards. For this reason we've never had to reach over the score track area of our boards, reducing the risk of messing it up.

Respuesta 2:
My player boards are slightly concave as a whole, so they spin on flat surfaces if bumped at all! The heavier tiles mostly stay put but the poor score markers get thrown about.

Respuesta 3:
We happened to play this last weekend right after playing Sagrada. Everybody acknowledged that some sort of overlay to place the score marker into (like Sagrada has for the dice) would vastly help in the bumping-the-stupid-marker-off-the-board department...but it's also still a fairly minor quibble with the game as a whole. We also talked about how you could simply keep score with pencil and paper if you really had a major issue with it.

Tema 517: Board Game Librarian Reviews: Azul
Pregunta:
Azul
Published by Plan B Games
Designed by Michael Kiesling
2-4 players
30-45 minute playing time
Ages 8 and up
Number of times played: At least ten
*Per usual there will be very little rules explanation*

Oddly enough (or perhaps not), this is my second Plan B review in the short history of this blog. Anyone who has played either Century: Golem Edition or Century: Spice Road would become a convert to Plan B's games.
I had been stalking Azul on Instagram since it was announced in the fall of 2017. What caught my attention was the beautiful artwork and Starburst-like tiles. I knew as soon as I saw it that I needed this game in my life. For me to say that I wanted an abstract is pretty unheard of. We were lucky that our friend Chris was able to procure a copy for us for Christmas before it went out of stock seemingly everywhere.
So is this game deserving of the hype train that it has been riding? Yes. Here's the thing not only about Azul, but other abstracts like   and  : they are getting non-abstract fans like me to love and appreciate them. Part of it is likely due to artwork, components, but a large part is in different "theming" and ease of play. All three of those examples are games that I would play any time of day and any number of times. I find all three of these games to be like candy (or potato chips in my case): you can't play just once.

I have played this game exclusively at two players but have taught it at four. What is nice is that the game seems to level nicely at the larger and smaller player count. Here again, like Century: Golem Edition, is a game that you can play twice in one sitting and have a completely different game and experience.
I have heard that game play in Azul can be quite mean sometimes, but I have not personally experienced that. I can see how it can be: you are playing with someone who you know is working towards filling in all of the light blue snowflakes and you steal them out from under them. Or you purposefully leave 8 tiles in the middle for someone to take mondo negative points. My times playing with my husband has been quite a zen experience- often when it comes down to the final tiles in the middle pool, I will ask him what he needs (perhaps this is why I am not winning?). At the start of each game I challenge myself to either collect all of one color for the ten end game bonus points, or fill in as many columns as possible for the seven end game bonus points. Sometimes I fail, sometimes I succeed. Neither my husband nor I have completely filled in our player board, and of all the posts on Instagram I have done, I have not seen anyone reach that achievement (sounds like a house rule mega end game bonus point). If you have filled in your player board on Azul, I would love to see it and hear your strategy!

Here are some things I have been loving about what Plan B is doing:
1. Publishing games that are easy to learn. You can learn how to play these games in less than 5 minutes. There are not complicated rules or concepts to learn.
2. Some of the best rulebooks in the board game industry. Easy, simple to follow, clear instructions. Granted, neither Azul nor the Century games are complex games and require huge rulebooks, but I have no doubt that if Plan B were to publish a more complex game their rulebooks would be equally stellar.
3. Vibrant, beautiful, colorful artwork. With Azul's artwork I feel as though I am truly in a Moorish palace. You can tell that the artist   did his research on the design of the time period.
4. Games that are ridiculously easy to teach. I taught Azul at my last library game event, and not only did I have a steady crowd of people, but people who wanted to play it again and again. As someone who teaches a lot of games to a variety of skill levels, having a game that I can teach in easy terms quickly is very important.
5. Publishing games that you really only want to beat your previous score or personal best. Frankly, all I want to do is beat my last score with each of these games and try new strategies. In Azul's case, if you are looking for a challenge, you can always try the backside of your personal player board and fill in the tiles yourself.

Rating: 7.75 (a huge number for an abstract for me!)
I would highly recommend this for play in a library setting. It was extremely popular for my group and players sat down for multiple plays of the game. Easy to teach and each for people to catch on to.

Respuesta 1:
Thanks for the review. I haven't yet played Azul (or Sagrada), but I love Santorini and agree that pretty components and the merest of themes can win me over to an abstract game!

Just waiting now for a re-release of Azul and Sagrada so I can get hold of these beauties for a reasonable price!



Tema 518: Azul: beautiful, quick, fun, and for any game collection
Pregunta:
Well here’s a game that needs no introduction, nor even likely any help from a positive review from the likes of me, but here’s one anyway.

Azul is a beautiful abstract game, ostensibly about building tiled walls in Portugal. The tile pieces are chunky and heavy, are about the same size as Starburst candies, and are as brightly colored. Each player has their own board with a score track, five rows of scaffolding for storing selected tiles in a round, a wall area made up of a grid of five rows (each associated with a scaffold row) and five columns where tiles eventually make their way from the scaffold to the wall. Sometimes you end up with extra tiles that cannot be stored on your platform; these end up on the floor in spaces that deliver a few negative points.

Points are scored by decorating your wall with tiles – and the more tiles you can place adjacent to other tiles will score more points each round. Tiles on a floor lead to negative points, though they are sometimes unavoidable or still the most productive move, and there are end-game bonuses for completed horizontal and vertical rows as well as placing five of the same color tile. The player with the most points at the end of a round with at least one completed horizontal row across all player boards (the game-end trigger) wins.

To play, first you take tiles from factories (careful not to mix them up with your coasters!) which start with four random tiles each. But when you take tiles you pick a factory, and then pick a tile color (from one of five possible colors - each color also has its own pretty design). You only take tiles of that color, while the rest go to a discard pool. Once there are tiles in the discard pile you can also select tiles from there (still maintaining the only-tiles-of-one-color rule), though the first player to do so also takes the first player marker (a big advantage!) but that marker acts like a broken tile, placed on the floor for one or more negative points. Selected tiles are placed in a staging area (your “scaffolding”) until the round ends. Only one color may go on one scaffold row – once you start a scaffold any tiles you add to that row must match. But a second key rule is that you must take all the tiles of one color from the factory you select (or the discard pile). You can’t leave matching tiles in the discard because you don’t want them on your scaffold! No room in your scaffolding? Extra tiles fall to the floor, broken, for negative points.

At the end of each round one (and only one) tile will move from each full scaffolding across the row to an available position in your wall, and you will gain points – with more points scored as you are able to line up tiles to create longer horizontal and vertical lines. The rest of the tiles in that scaffold row are discarded, while partially-filled rows remain and can be finished in the next rounds. You’ll then be able to enjoy digging around your discarded tiles bowl, listening to them clack and click together, and making extra towers and designs between turns.

But it gets tricky. Your board is only five by five spaces. Only one tile color is allowed per row AND column. Each row of scaffolding can only hold one single color, no matter how many tiles it might hold (from one to five). And remember that discard pool? As it gets larger and larger any player can decide to take from it instead of an available factory, so your discards can end up giving your opponents just what they need. Or you may end up having to take tiles of a color that you can’t place, which means they all fall to the floor to the broken tile spaces.

The game scales extremely well across the stated two to four players. You simply play with fewer factories with two or three players, with no other complicated rule changes like limiting the number of colors. Azul is easy to teach and learn – about 10 minutes – and usually finishes in about a half hour. Once you get the hang of the game you can flip over your player board to a more advanced side. While the base game has tile placements already determined uniformly for every player board, the advanced version provides a blank space to fill in as you like – though you still must maintain only one of each color per row and column, which can create very thorny problems for players.

Azul is a great game to consider adding to your game night – it plays quick, is easy to learn, and it may have the most beautiful components in a game. It can fit right in as a filler, as a quick game while you are waiting for another table to finish, or if you want to stretch out the night another 30 minutes.

Respuesta 1:
Nice balanced review of a really good game.
We have had a few cut-throat 4 player games on both board options.

The random tile distribution has an amazing effect on things especially when people start to take stuff they don`t need just to cause someone pain.

Still great fun though.

What is so beautiful about this game?
The components are really nice, the setup takes about 2 minutes, and the rules explanation takes less than 5. Despite all of this streamlining done to the game, there are still difficult decisions to make at each of your turns (especially later in the game). The difficulty ramps up as more and more of your wall fills up since your choices become more limited. Early rounds seem to go fast as players are snatching up high volumes of tiles to fill their more difficult bottom rows. There is a lot of hate-drafting as well. You definitely want to know what your opponents will be going for so you can set up a block, or ensure you get your tiles early, or simply incentivize them to take some other colors that would end up broken on your floor.

All in all, it's a really slick and complete game that can be played in about 15-20 minutes with two players. I haven't tried it with three or four yet, but I imagine it'll still be fun, just a slower experience.

Respuesta 5:
I played my first game tonight and I was impressed with how quick the game plays and how easy it was to learn. There were two of us who never played it and once the first round was underway, the rest was intuitive. I like how you can make a lot of meaningful choices especially during the latter rounds. I'd like to introduce this game to my other group once I get a copy. As for now, it's sold out around me area and someone else posting it for double the price.

It was interesting to realize that my opinion was coming from
elitism/gamerism that I'd developed. After all, why shouldn't
good games with broad appeal be on top of the charts, even if
they're not design masterpieces of deep strategy and tactics?

Indeed it's nice to see a non-complex game rise to the top 50. The only other game with limited complexity in the Top 50 seems to be Codenames.



Tema 522: Clarification on colors
Pregunta:
Just to be sure I'm doing things correctly, it is legal to have two rows working at the same time, right? The image above shows blue in the top (1) row and the second (2) row. This is okay?

If so, can I place blue in both rows on the same turn?

Respuesta 1:
Yes, you can.

Respuesta 2:
Yup...two rows working at the same time is fine.

You can only place on one row per turn though.

Respuesta 3:
Yes, you can have the same colour on multiple rows at once. But you can never split a single set of tiles you've taken between rows.

@Brodie17
Yup...two rows working at the same time is fine.

Just to clarify this statement, you can only place your picked tiles on one row's "pattern line" each turn (any excess tiles falling to the "floor line").

During the wall tiling phase, you can tile from two completed pattern lines that happen to hold the same color.

Respuesta 5:
Can I also start a new row before finish another? Example: I have 4 blue in the lower row and I take 4 blue, I don't want to put 3 tile in the floor so I put all 4 tile in the row with 4 space.

Yes.

Witness 2 rows of Blue in the two diagrams at the start of the section "B. Wall-tiling" on page 4.

Note how the word "one" is bolded in this sentence fragment quoted from page 3.

Then, add the tiles you picked to one of the 5 pattern lines on your player board ...

By this quote the regular rules still apply.

Variant play
For a slightly different game, use
the gray side of the player boards.
Rules are exactly the same as in the
normal game, except that when you
move a tile from a pattern line to
the wall, you may place it on any
space of its corresponding wall line.
However, as the game progresses, in
each of the 5 vertical lines of your
wall, no color may appear more
than once.



Tema 525: Turn order variation
Pregunta:
So I felt that you could get a little bit annoyed if the player to your right were always blocking your interests. So I tried implementing switching direction of play after every new round.
We all liked this especially me who really dont like blocking all that much. Gave the game a little more gentle feel somehow.

Just thought Id share.

Respuesta 1:
Meh. I think the turn order is a very important consideration that makes the 1st player token more valuable.

Respuesta 2:
Switching direction doesn't seem to make being first any less valuable. This seems a nice idea!

Respuesta 3:
In my opinion in thousands of game that there are which have a similar mechanism of turn order i.e "the person to get the 1st player token goes first", always benefits the the person going next to the first player(i.e second player, eg. in Azul the second player never took the penalty of the first player token and yet gets a nice selection of options to choose from.

A simple turn order track solves it, wherein the first player places his token on the leftmost space and the remaining player tokens slide to next available space on the right.

Respuesta 4:
I think this has more to do with evening out hate drafting--if the person on your right is constantly hate drafting you, well... it doesn't matter where you are sitting in relationship to the first player. Reversing play means if you feel like you are being hate drafted by someone, at least it will only happen half of the time, and you can return the favor if you feel so inclined.

...not that think about hate drafting much but I can understand the sentiment.

Respuesta 5:
Yeah, I had a recent 3p game that fell into a pattern where my LHO would often create nice batches in the middle for my RHO and she would take them, thus not creating any new opportunities for me. It would have been nice to be able to mix that up a bit

Respuesta 6:
I came here looking to see if someone had suggested this variant, as it occurred to me.

I don't see any downside. Most drafting games do this.

I began considering it after a 3 player game where 2 players were playing very strategically, and the 3rd wasn't paying any attention to the other players. So the player sitting "down wind" of that player had a huge advantage and won by a large margin.

Switching turn order rotation will even-out several types of lopsided gameplay.

(I like the idea of the turn order track, but likely won't implement it due to slight fiddliness and a lack of components to implement it quickly/easily.)

Respuesta 7:
I'll re-post this as it's own topic so please respond there.

Full Variable Turn Order for Azul 3p and 4p:

Draw out a random tile for each player as their base color to place on the corner of their board. This will lower the ratios of those colors and make them more difficult to place. If you wish to keep the same ratios of tiles then substitute some type of colored paper, cardboard, wooden/plastic meeples, dice, etc from something else in blue, red, black, white, and yellow.

Mock up a Variable turn order card. Please note that these are suggested starting values subject to more playtesting.
1st player is -1vp.
2nd player is -1vp.
3rd player is +0vp.
4th player is +1vp.

The 1st player tile will still be in the middle. The 1st player for the next round will be the player who takes this tile from the middle. This will now give them a net of -2vp instead of just -1vp. This player places their color from their board on the turn order card.

To be the 2nd player in the next round a player must now select their tiles 1st from anywhere. They place their board tile on the turn order card for -1vp.

The 3rd player will also be the next to select their tiles from anywhere and places their color tile on the turn order card. Once the 3rd player selects their tiles, the 4th player is set, places their tile on the 4th spot and will receive +1vp during scoring.

In the event that players are unable to draft their color tiles then remaining players will be placed clockwise in even rounds and counter-clockwise in odd rounds from the last player on the turn order card.

We do this, too. I even had my daughter make a disc with clockwise swirls on one side and counterclockwise on the other to put in the center of the factory displays to remind us which direction we're on.

Respuesta 9:
Just thinking about this a bit.

You could make up Player 2, 3, and 4 tiles to put in the center. Now the player 1 tile would give a -1 to scoring that round but the others would not. Here is how it would work:

Player 1 is the first player to draw from the center and gets a -1
Player 2 takes the Player 2 tile by being the second person to draw from the center and so on.

It does take a bit of keeping track of what turn you have but if you have 2 number tokens of each one to place on a blank space on the board you could make it easier. Likewise if the backside of the player tile numbers is blank. You take your turn, flip the number tile over, if everyone has gone you all flip the tile over and you have the numbers again. When scoring is over you simply put all player number tiles in the center again.

I think that I may try this with some experienced players and see what happens.

Tema 527: Azul: Worth more than $28?
Pregunta:
Azul was the only game that I had the patience to sit down and play a demo of at PAX Unplugged in Philadelphia. It was two rows in on the left, among a sea of living, breathing, "con-crud".

It was a game that I had heard about a few weeks prior. A tile-laying game, or something. You are supposed to be a Portuguese worker, recreating patterns on a wall somewhere for someone important. Zee Garcia was receiving a bunch of flack for saying that the game had no theme, but he ultimately enjoyed it. I completely understood, and was intrigued.

It wasn't even available to purchase at the convention, or maybe it was, but I was only able to get to the convention after 7pm, so it definitely wasn't available to me.

ANYWAY, two weeks later, I was able to pick up a copy of Azul from CoolStuffInc.com at the regular price of $28...what I believe the game is ultimately worth.

So here's your real quick, previously uninformed, overview:

So, how's the game set-up?

1. There are a number of circular markers (determined by player count) circling the board, all of which start each round with four tiles that have been drawn from a bag.
2. In the middle of the circle, is a cardboard chit, marked "1". This is the eventual "player 1" marker. This marker is acquired by the first player to take tiles from the center.
3. Each player receives a black cube, their point marker.

So let's do a quick run through of the game:

1. There is a 5x5 grid on a player board on your right.
2. There are 5 different colors on that grid, none of which repeat in the same column or row.
3. The left side of your board has five rows. Your job is to fill those rows with the same color tiles. At the end of a round, when a row is filled, it's corresponding spot on the grid gets filled in, allowing a player to score points at the end of the round.
4. Chaining tiles together on the grid allows players to increase their score.
5. The game ends when any player has completed a row at the end of a round. A final scoring happens, and the highest score wins.

So what happens between set-up and the end of the game?

1. Each player will take all of the same color (they are also marked, if you just so happen to be colorblind) tiles from either a round marker OR the center pile of the board. If a player choses from a circular marker, the remaining tiles are pushed to the inside of the play area. The first player to take from the center of the board also takes the "player 1" token, which can only be placed on the overflow section of the board.
2. Once tiles are chosen, they must be committed to one of the five rows on the left side of the player board. Keeping in mind that tiles can only be committed to ONLY ONE ROW. So if too many tiles are acquired, they must be sent to an "overflow" area at the bottom of the player board. The overflow area assigns a negative point value for every tile that occupies a space.
3. Eventually a player completes a ROW, ending the game. A final scoring occurs for all players, awarding an extra two points for completing rows, an extra seven points for completing columns, and an extra ten points for filling in five spaces of the same color on the appropriate spaces on the board.

And so my thoughts in review, for what they are worth...

Months later, we are still playing Azul, as it is the most frequently requested game from my recent pick ups.

My "gaming-tolerant" friends are playing it. My "gaming-intolerant" family is playing it. My "standard issue" gaming group is playing it.

The only problem is that we only have one copy, MY copy. So if anyone in any of those three groups really wanted it, they'd be disappointed. I paid the $28 at the right place, at the right time. Plan B games decided to go with one of those infamous exclusive distributions, causing a lack of availability, and a MAJOR hike in price via third parties. So WAIT for it, it's a very good abstract game, but absolutely worth nothing more than $28. It is DEFINITELY one of those games that with some minor creativity, and a trip to "Michael's" could be recreated for about $15 with some makeshift components and a basic understanding of the rules.

The components in the box are worth the $40. I got a copy from Plan B direct and found a copy at my FLGS for a friend and paid $40 for it, too. No regrets.

Respuesta 3:
I would tend to agree, Dave. It is an awesome game- my favorite abstract at the moment- but I would also wait until the availability makes it more affordable. I paid $35 for my copy and another $35 for the gift copy I gave away. That seems about right for the FLGS I like to support and because I really wanted to have it after playing. If it had been over that amount, I think I would have waited on it to come down and just get it from Amazon. $28-30 seems like a good price for this game.

Respuesta 4:
Someone offered me super bowl tickets on the 50 yard line for $28 but I had to turn it down. At the end of the day, the components were just a rectangular piece of paper so it was hard to justify.

True, but if you can get the same enjoyment out of $2 worth of pieces of cardboard and plastic you can assemble in 1 minute as you can from a game costing $60 then go the $2 route.

However, if you gain more than $58 in enjoyment from the high end pieces, by all means do that.

That's fair. I know I couldn't assemble a satisfying version of the game in a minute with things lying around my house. For me it'd be more like at least a couple of hours running to the store looking for suitable bits, designing mats, printing them, etc, and it would still be inferior after spending significant time and some money to do it. But if you can whip up a copy in a minute, yes, that's certainly an understandable position.

Plus I do place some value in the IP. I like knowing that I'm supporting the designer and what is still a relatively small hobby even if a big chunk of that goes to a retailer or reseller in this case.

Respuesta 13:
Take this for what it's worth, but mostly we think of games as entertainment vs. whatever the 'shelf value' of the cardboard and components are.

A movis is, like what, $10 per person for 2 hours of movie that you might not even like? We look at games the same way. We spent whatever on it, compared to a movie (even if it's one-off), did we have 2 hours of a good time (without paying $10 for popcorn and another $10 for drinks)?

Most of the time, we say yes, but sometimes we don't. I got Azul from MM, so I was lucky on the price -- but we've had enough fun with it on the movie theater standard that we could have easily paid more and felt good about it.

It's our standard, not yours, I already know that, please don't start a flame war about the comparison.

Respuesta 16:
I look at purchases this way, if you like the price and can afford it then buy it. If not, skip it and buy something cheaper. Azul has some of the nicest components I have seen and is one game my wife really likes. It was well worth the purchase price to get it to the table with her as often as we do. I have paid more for a few games and they never see the light of day. The board game industry is a lot like buying wine. Some people will pay more for a bottle of wine and some people can do with the cheap stuff you can get at Walmart. I was glad I made the purchase on this game. Splendor is another game that costs a lot, but gives you a good bang for the buck.

Tema 528: Question for veteran players - number of rounds
Pregunta:
Has anyone tried playing with a fixed set of rounds instead of finishing when someone completes a row?

I have this feeling that the game would be great at 7 rounds for 2 players, 6 for 3 players and 5 for 4 players. I simply won't have the opportunity to play with two players for a while to try. It's just that I find the later rounds so much more interesting that the first 2 with 2 and 3 players, then it ends abruptly.

It's so rare that I have the feeling that a game should actually have more rounds!

With over 100 plays under my belt (and testing this), more rounds are a mixed bag. In some ways there's more tension and more opportunities to hate draft. In some ways it becomes more obvious what players are going for and there's less of a decision tree.

Further it flattens the scores to benefit the player who beat chain scored previous rounds as many end game bonuses are shared.

Try it though and see if it fits your play style. It just wasn't for me

Respuesta 2:
Sounds like an interesting variant, but I'm having too much fun with the RAW at the moment so probably won't get around to testing this anytime soon.

One of the great challenges of the game, if you think you are behind, is to try to lengthen the game to do just what EchoOperative suggests. You can do this by taking the tiles the leader needs to complete a row.

Respuesta 3:
Thanks, it all makes sense, I guess. It's just that I keep looking at those end game bonus with 2 players and it feels like they point towards some goal to achieve, some place you should get to, but you merely ever reach its borders, then the game ends before you can really step onto it.

But it makes sense and I guess I simply have not played enough games.

That's a pity. This is a fine opportunity to improve upon those fiddly personal score trackers. I believe that the game would benefit from a central score track. We can hardly get through a game without somebody wondering if they knocked a cube or miscounted somewhere. We have found paper and pencil to provide a more reliable means of scoring than the supplied components.

Massive +1 for an improved 1st player token and improvements to the score tracker.

Thank you. Please let the team know that a number of people find the personal score tracks prone to error. Not only can your cube move when you don't want it to, but even if you do notice or suspect an error, there's a slim chance of reconciling it. Additionally, a collective score track allows you to see at a glance how well you're doing. This feature in itself provides additional safeguards against score or scorer errors.

Played 15 games, 2-3-4 players. Never had a problem with the score board. But everyone recognizes they need to be careful. Last night a person almost pulled his score marker off when clearing his board of tiles. I happened to see the accident coming and stopped him in the nick of time. So, yes, it can happen - and probably will at some point (law of averages, I suppose: if it can happen, it will eventually happen). But we haven't really had a miss-step through 15 games.

C. Preparing the next round

If nobody has completed a horizontal line of 5 consecutive tiles on her wall yet (see End of the game), prepare the next round. The player with the starting player marker refills each of the Factory displays with 4 tiles from the bag as in the setup. If the bag is empty, refill it with all the tiles that you have placed in the lid of the game box and then continue filling the remaining Factory displays. Then, start the new round.

They shipped the package sooner than I thought but it only contained the spice road playmat. They’re sending me the tiles and I should get them next week. Mistakes happen, but the frustrating part is communication. Their phone system is 100% French, not unusual for a Quebec company, but rough to deal with as an American who doesn’t speak French.

We player a 5-player game on New Year's. It worked pretty well. We added 5 of each tile type and two more factories. It seemed to scale to five nicely. I'm not sure I would go any further with the player count, but a 6-player game might be interesting.
Tested 8 - it's a hot mess
I have two copies so that we can play with more than 4 - but it might also work (if you have 6-8 players) to simply play two 3/4 player games at the same time. But for a 5-player (which we often have) the extra 25 tiles works quite well.

Respuesta 5:
The interaction gets less interesting the more players you add - I prefer not to go beyond 3...

Respuesta 6:
Old thread, but I wanted to report on trying the 5+5 option.
It seemed to work pretty well. We added the suggested 5 tiles of each type, and two coasters. The scores ranged from about 40-65.

Getting the first player tile was more important, but because there were more coasters the 4 and 5 players still had options to pick from.

We are going to try it again

Respuesta 7:
Surprised at how few comments were left on this subject. Presumably with a 5th board you can play with the existing components and exhaust them in the same way as other multiplayer games with higher player counts. Expanding the components serves to keep games fluffy, with such generosity extending the length of play.

If there is advantages in encouraging players to fill their “walls” then you might be playing it from a different perspective. A lot of folks prefer puzzle games to be tight, or a bit mean.

5-6 player game tend to be less about maintaining control. Rather things become a touch more chaotic which tends to be fun if you have a good group to play with.

Adding 25 tiles and using 11 factories seems overly generous. 10 or even 9 factories could be enough. Be surprised if 10 or 15 extra tiles doesn’t keep things ticking over for 5 players. Could even just throw your 10 joker tiles in, which can be easily proxied these days!



Tema 535: Variant for a Slightly Longer Game
Pregunta:
My parents have been enjoying playing Azul head-to-head but they wished the game would last a round or two longer. So I suggested they play until 2 rows have been completed and score 1 bonus point for completing the top row, 2 points (like normal) for completing the 2nd row and 4, 8 and 16 for completing rows 3, 4 and 5. So you would score 17 bonus points, for example, for completing the top and bottom rows. They really like this. One can try to rush the game if they see the other is trying for the big 16 point bonus. Since they are in their 70's and easily forget, they made little scoring column reminders that they taped to their boards. Seems like this variant would work well with more players. The high bonuses for the lower rows would be haorder to obtain but you're getting a nice exponential bump for trying.

Respuesta 1:
Interesting. I guess one can simply play until two rows have been completed without any change to the points calculation too. It's a huge difference though.

What we have started to do is a minor change, but it helps with having a chance to complete a color. When a row has been completed, the next round is the last (2-players) That's a single round added to game, but it's often enough to compete for a color.

We thought about saying that the game ends when any row but the first has been completed. Never tried.

Respuesta 2:
Or you can just play it back to back. We have. Great game



Tema 536: May I deliberately pick up tiles I can't add to any line when there are other tiles I can add ?
Pregunta:
Example: there is two red tiles and three blue tiles left.

I could place the red tiles on one of my lines.
I can't place the blue tiles on any line as my wall already has 5 blue tiles.
But I'm not really interested in red tiles, and over all, another player really need the blue tiles.

May I deliberately take the blue tiles I can't place anywhere but on the floor instead of the red tiles I could place on one of my lines ?

Thanks !

Respuesta 1:
Yes.

Respuesta 2:
Yes, you may. You can also take tiles that you *could* place but still decide to put them on the floor instead.

Respuesta 3:

You can even take the red tiles and place it all on the floor.

Nope, you can always choose to drop tiles to the floor, even if they can be placed on a pattern line:

I believe our own Sophie Gravel came up with the theme. Originally the game was about art, Mr. Kiesling was rock solid with the design and the game was great. However, we needed to market it a little different to make it stand out. I was told that the azulejos struck her as a perfect combination (mechanism and art/graphic design). Shortly after, our lead illustrator Chris Quilliams did a deep dive into the history of the tiles and their artistic evolution. The rest is history. Check out PlanBGames.com for a blog entry and interview with Chris Quilliams and Philippe Guerin about the illustrative design process.

Respuesta 4:
Great interview, always interesting to learn about the creative process that leads to the final version of the game. And the theme is an absolute winner for me, I'm just happy that the game underneath also has legs

Tema 539: Two off the Top: An Azul Review
Pregunta:
Azul

Two off the Top Review

Players: 2-4

Time: 20-25 minutes

Times Played: 10+

Over the course of my short time span of writing reviews, I typically have one queued up and ready for the Monday where I post and anywhere between two to ten sitting and awaiting final editing before they’re posted. Sometimes I might sneak a review in due to it being the flavor of the month (PAX) or an upcoming arrival (Venus Next), but for the most part, everything is set in stone…

…or was, until I got my hands-on Azul.




 
The first thing you’ll notice about Azul is the box art and within it, the components. Everything is colorful and eye-catching; the production quality is top notch and the thick tiles are directly inspired by the Moorish tiles found in Spain and Portugal. I also love that the back of the box gives you a quick rundown of how to play the game, which is awesome. I wish more games had this as a feature. It was a major selling point on purchasing the game.



After we were done being dazzled by the artwork and color that Azul offered, we played a two-player game. Then we did a best of three. Then five. Then seven. Then we played the variant on the back. Then we invited friends over. We fell in absolute love with it.

The basis of Azul is that you are an artist that specializes in tile-laying and you have been commissioned to display your artwork on the walls of the Royal Palace of Evora. Depending on the number of players, there are a set number of factories available each round that have a random assortment of four tiles (pulled from a drawstring bag) laid upon them that can be used to create your art.



When a player wants to take a tile(s) from a factory, they must take all of that type available. If there are two blue, one red, and one black tile and the player wants to take the blue tiles, they must take both blue tiles. The remaining tiles (the red and black) are moved to the street. Street tiles can also be taken once they start to appear but the same rules apply. The first player to take from the street will go first in the following round but will also lose one point for going to the street first (sub-par quality of tiles I suspect). There is a marker that designates this so it is not forgotten.



The tiles that you have just chosen are now added to your player board and placed in a single row. There can only ever be one color per row so once you complete a color, you will not be able to place that color there again. There are five rows, increasing from one tile to five tile requirements. At the end of a round, if a row is completely filled in, that color tile is added to the player’s wall. If tiles are grabbed that don’t fit your wall, they are placed in the row at the bottom of the player board that designates “broken” tiles that will lose you points. The more broken tiles you have, the more points you will lose this round.



This continues until all tiles are gone from the factories and streets. Once that occurs, scoring happens. Players can score themselves and the score tracker for each player is attached to their player board. Each tile is worth one point for placement but if placed adjacent to other tiles, they will score an additional point for each tile in an adjacent horizontal and/or vertical line. Any non-completed rows will carryover until the next round. Tiles that were removed from your player board are placed in the box lid and only added back to the game when the draw bag is empty.



Play continues until one player completes one horizontal row on their board. Once that happens, the game ends and the players tally their scores. Horizontal rows are worth an additional two points, vertical rows are worth an additional seven points, and having placed all five of one color is worth ten points. The highest score wins.



Azul is definitely an abstract game at heart but the production quality alone really makes you think that maybe you are a part of a design team for a palace. Maybe you are trying to piece together the perfect tiled wall for your benefactor. Azul has more of a thematic setting than Santorini, Patchwork, Blokus, or Photosynthesis, which may not be saying much as the bar is set exceedingly low for abstract strategy games, but at least there is something here that at least feels like you’re doing more than shuffling colored tiles around. Add all of that with the mechanic for losing points due to dropping tiles and the theme is a touch above transparent.

I think that abstract games get a bad name because there’s no “hook” to get people initially invested. A lot of times, the subject matter and how you resolve the “conflict” aren’t enough to draw people in. You’re not bringing dinosaurs back to life, you’re not eradicating a disease that is enveloping the globe, and you’re a submarine captain trying to sink a rival submersible. Which is fine. Sometimes I just want to play a game to play a game. I don’t need a rich backstory.

I do think one of Azul’s greatest strengths is also one of its greatest weaknesses. The production quality of the game, while extraordinary, are also without a doubt a key contributor to the cost of the game. Board games, unfortunately, are not a cheap hobby to get into and when pressed to pay upwards of $40 for one game, many people will be hard pressed to purchase an abstract tile-placement game that plays in under thirty minutes over something that has more teeth to it, such as another recent release, Pandemic: Rising Tides.





A few other negatives to take note of are that after only ten or so plays, we already are having the boards warp and with how flimsy everything is (as you’re just placing tiles on top of the player board), having them warp and become more susceptible to being knocked around and messing up your hard work is not something that will keep this game in my good graces. Let’s couple that with the score tracker being on top of the player board, which makes sense, I get it. It allows all players to score on their own which in turn speeds up the entirety of the game but again, it’s not a set-in place track so any bumping of the player board could send your score marker flying. I would also be amiss to not mention what two people from my gaming group mentioned as things they did not like, which would be the lack of numbers on the scoring track. The track counts in increments of five, which is great for the later game when points start stacking up but can be a pain for the beginning when your score is low and for when inevitably the table or board shake and your score tracker is knocked around.



We also wish Azul included two draw bags as opposed to the one, so instead of placing discarded tiles in the box lid, they would go in another bag ready to be used when needed. It’s a small issue but honestly the longest part of any of our games is transferring tiles from the box lid to the bag.




 
I also think Azul might be plagued with a runaway issue due to whoever is the very first player having a distinct advantage and I think this is a case in games with new players, which is obviously true for most games. Once players have an understanding of the game and the strategy, our wins have not appeared to have been dictated by the first player to make a move. This situation is really only an issue in two player games and looking back at the games that we’ve logged, statistically, I am proven wrong with five wins by the starting player, four losses by the starting player, and one tie. This is only referring to two-player match-ups and to be fair, include some of our first ever plays where strategy was not optimized. Even with data showing otherwise, I still feel as though the advantage exists and now that I am logging all of our plays for 2018, this is something I can definitely look back upon in 365 days.

Okay, all the negatives out of the way so let’s be blunt: I love this game. I absolutely love this game at two-player, I really like this game at three-player, but at four players, I’m indifferent. At four players, going for the street tiles happens more often and if it doesn’t, tiles tend to pile up and a player or two is left with an eight or nine tile haul, especially in the later game when spots have been filled and vacancies are at a premium. I want to like this. The player interaction and being the cause of an opponent losing eight points to end the round fits right in with our playstyle but it’s more sad than anything. I actually felt bad for my opponents being left with such a lackluster haul.



Azul might be our new favorite two-player game. Patchwork, Mr. Jack in New York, and Agricola: All Creatures Big and Small are some of our go-to games for relatively quick excursions but Azul is becoming a quick contender. Will it have the longevity to stay with those two heavyweights is a question I can only speculate on but I would not be surprised to see Azul end this new year as one of the most played games in our collection.

Azul is a game with simple mechanics, simple components, simple set-up, and simple strategy. As the game play’s so quickly and is so elementary to learn, it makes each and every play more rewarding than the one prior to it. This is a game that I know will be a hit with my non-gamer groups, particularly my parents.

Could there be analysis paralysis due to the game requiring planning ahead? I don’t think so. After the first and second games, most people have a feel for the approach that Azul commands and can typically plan their turn as the other player makes their move. As the tiles are random each turn, there isn’t much to do between rounds except hope for the best. With there being an equal amount of every tile, there’s never an issue with seeing one color more than another either.

As with another abstract game I’m fond of, Photosynthesis, Azul can be a mean game and I actually think it can be meaner than Photosynthesis. Hear me out. In Photosynthesis, your moves are made in plain sight and everyone is aware that you are blocking a player out for a suns rotation or two. While you might be peeved at it, you knew it was coming and while you did not gain points, you did not lose any either. But Azul on the other hand all takes place on your player board, so taking a piece(s) that your opponent needs doesn’t necessarily look like a direct dig at them but everyone knows the move was made due to your opponent’s board. As the first move of a round you might get a groan or some muttering under the breath as there is time to recover but leaving your opponent with five tiles they cannot use on the last turn that nets them eight negative points will leave require people to check their emotions at the door.



Personally? I love it. Games are meant to be fun and competitive and what is competition if I cannot directly contend with my opponent(s)?

Azul’s player boards are double-sided and the backside offers a blank mosaic wall to complete. This offers a little bit of a change as the mosaic is no longer static. We would have much rather had a bigger board or a different static mosaic so you could pit one against another. Maybe in time the variant will grow on us but after our first few run-throughs, it didn’t add enough spice to make us want to do it again. For full transparency, we were playing the variant incorrectly and only allowing one color per column and not one color per row AND column. We hope to rectify this soon in our future playthroughs. Shout out to /u/jrallen7 for the correction!





I think the major issue is that it just seems to take too long. We replenished the bag at least twice as much as a normal game, as everyone tried to maximize their points value.

With all that said, there is still one big question that remains unanswered: Does it bug us that you don’t actually complete the tiled mosaic?



Answer: Not at all. I think that’s why I want to keep playing over and over again. That sense that I did not accomplish what I set out to do and there is more I could have done or a better approach I could have taken. If I completely finished the mosaic, it would be like a puzzle that I have completed and would not want to do again.

Every so often I play a game that just invigorates and reignites my love of board games and Azul has done just that. I cannot think of a better way to conclude 2017 and start 2018 than with this sense of energy and excitement. In short, I cannot recommend Azul enough.

Respuesta 1:
Great review! If I didn't already love and own this game, I'd run out and buy it after reading your thorough analysis of the pros and cons. I also highly recommend it to people. Great at all player counts, in my opinion. Love how different it feels at 2-player as opposed to more players.

You also gave me the great idea to just add another bag to the box, to place discarded tiles as we go. Why didn't I think of that? Saves time, as you mentioned. Although I wouldn't use the second bag for 2-player, as it makes a big difference to keep count of colored tiles for the 10-point end game bonus. Most 2-player games end after five rounds, so the used tiles aren't recycled like in 3 and 4-player games. This is important info to keep in mind when selecting tiles each round. Easier to do when the discard tiles are sitting right there for double checking your count of how many different color tiles are remaining in the bag for future rounds.

Respuesta 2:
I use three clear glass 'game bit bowls' to store the discarded tiles (they're the bowls I use for all games, and are actually intended for some sort of culinary use). These are very quick to pour into the bag when it's empty, but also still enable you to see what colours have been discarded, in what quantities.

So I feel like the first three to five games or so are skewed W/L wise as we try to figure out our play style and strategy. Ignoring those games and there's a 60/40 split for the start player winning.

The start player gets first dibs at all tiles, gets to see what their opponent(s) is doing, and then gets a shot at going first again (at the detriment of one point). It's a big benefit.

But like I said, I could totally be wrong. It's just a gut feeling. One of those things that rests in the back of your mind. I am really excited to see where the data lies in December.

That's actually interesting. We don't keep tabs of what tiles have been discarded. They go into the box lid which is usually set aside and out of the way. I wonder how seeing that knowledge would impact our decision making and time of play as opposed to our quick math when viewing our opponents boards?

Every time we play any game with a pile of chits, I say I'm going to get a salad bowl or something out for this very usage and every time I forget. I actually have a collapsible painting cup that might work perfectly for this game...

True, but with only two plays, the pot isn't typically sweet enough to go to the street tiles on your first turn. But after both players have moved tiles to the street (in a two-player game), that option might become enticing.

You might download those files though and check for someone local. I know a local library here that had a 3D printing lab that's open to the public and they're very cheap to print things out.

Tema 542: Azul - Abstract or Not?
Pregunta:
Most reviewers call Azul an abstract game. Dictionary.com defines 'abstract' as
1. thought of apart from concrete realities, specific objects, or actual instances: an abstract idea.
2. expressing a quality or characteristic apart from any specific object or instance, as justice, poverty, and speed.
3. theoretical; not applied or practical: abstract science.
4. difficult to understand; abstruse: abstract speculations.


As for the first definition: Azul is a tile-laying game about...laying tile! Thus, by that definition, Azul is concrete, specific, and actual!! it is not an abstracted "idea." it is...what it is! That's about as concrete as you can get.

As for the second definition: It is too specific in nature to be an abstract. It has concrete goals, and a theme matched perfectly to the action of the game.

As for the third definition: It is in no sense 'theoretical.' It is what it is - laying tiles to score points as tile-layers gained prestige for their artistry.

As for the fourth definition: It is not difficult to understand, and the rules are very concrete.

Why, then, do we insist on calling this an abstract? I think every game has elements that have been abstracted in some fashion (example: all war-games have abstracted elements, but only a few are considered 'abstracts' - chess, checkers, etc. Yet, even deep war-games abstract weather, command, logistics, etc. So yes, there may be abstracted elements to the game, but is that any different than any other game (Terraforming Mars, Great Western Trail, etc.)?

For me - Azul is a wonderful game of laying azulejos on a wall with the most efficient artist winning the game. Perhaps some of you have a better grasp of 'abstract' and 'concrete' when it comes to games and can shed more light or intelligence on the issue. I welcome your thoughts either way.

Respuesta 1:
People like to debate abstracts, I lump them into this category based on the gameplay rather than the boxart.

  is clearly abstract, it has no theme at all.
If I made GIPF into a game of SpaceShip Bumper-Cars by changing the pieces and the board but not altering the rules all I have done is added a thin layer of 'paint' onto it. Is SpaceShip BumperCars now a Thematic game rather than Abstract?

What about  ? Is this abstract or thematic?

Azul is an Abstract Drafting game at its core, the tiles could easily be all white and numbered or lettered and that would not change the gameplay in anyway. The thematics and art of the game make this enjoyable to be sure and it matches well in many regards with the gameplay.

Look to the arguments as to whether   is an abstract game (It's currently the #1 abstract game!) for more thoughts.

My argument is that MOST Euro's can use the same mechanics and simply past on a different theme. Thus, they would be abstract by that definition. What makes Azul different is that the mechanics perfectly match the theme. You could just as well have started with the theme and added the mechanics as they fit well. As stated, it is a tile-laying game about...tile laying! The mechanic IS the theme and vice-versa. Thus - not an abstract in my mind. BUT - whether you deem it abstract or concrete - it is a great game!

Respuesta 3:
All games are at some level an abstraction, and whether it is considered abstract has no limit on the value of the game.

Azul has no grouting phase, no requirement that you tile in a certain order, and it makes no thematic sense that the tiles on the bottom of your wall cost 5 'tiles' as opposed to 1 at the top, if anything that should be reversed due to the challenge of dropping tiles from a higher part of the wall. Additionally the scoring and game end bears no relevance to the theme and are arbitrary.

If Azul were a thematic game about laying tiles I would expect that I'd need to actually FINISH tiling my wall section and be graded on things like symmetry or patterns, perhaps how well my wall fits into the wall tiling of my neighbors to the left and right.

I agree that it's a great game, and I agree that the theme offered is apt and that people connect with it. It's also an abstract game, in the end though I don't care if you don't want to call it abstract, please do what you like at your table, but hopefully I've helped you understand why people might call it abstract.

Respuesta 4:
Pretty much what Matt said. You only have a general thematic integration on the macro level, i.e. you are an artist/crafter putting tiles on a wall (or something like that) and it is pretty much only for the graphics and the components.

Most mechanics do not make much sense in this framework though. I cannot think of a single mechanic that is easier to explain or remember because of its thematic context, but in my opinion Azul does not really try to do this anyway. Why do you need so much variety in the different kind of tiles (not twice the same tile in rows or columns? Why take the rows different many tiles to complete? Why is there a differentiation between rows and columns anyway? Scoring (i.e. the goal of the game!) is based on a purely abstract mechanism. What do the factories actually represent; if I am decorating a wall, I certainly do not only get one to three tiles of a single color from a factory/shop/supplier. The mechanism of putting not-selected tiles in the middle is purely abstract.

This may sound like criticism but it is not. To me Azul is one of the highlights of 2017, especially in the "normal" game category (no legacy, no campaign, not epic lengths), since the mechanisms are really good and it plays at a very good pace. Even though you could replace the graphics by numbers or symbols, the nice tiles and also the graphics (on the factories) really improve the game by making it more enjoyable and rememberable.

I actually prefer games to be as abstract as Azul to games that try to explain all mechanics thematically, while there is too great of a disconnect between the mechanics and what they should represent.

Edit: Patchwork is pretty much the same category of abstract to me. I recognize the theme to be patchworking and players create a blanket. But how you select the patches from the row, the economy with the buttons, the time mechanism (why do tiles need this arbitrary amount of times to be sown in?) or the little bonus patches do not make much sense if you consider two players competing in making the best blanket. And it does not need to make sense. The theme is mainly for graphics and justifies why you deal with such arbitrary shapes in the first place and I am fine with that.

I agree with this. The game is excellent because it has great mechanics, the art design is the icing on the cake. There's nothing thematic about it really. When was the last time the OP tiled a wall by lining up the tiles and sliding them accross? It's an abstract mechanic with a (very well done) pasted on theme. And that's fine. For people who thought they didn't like abstracts Azul is a good test of that.

Respuesta 6:
Even though when I teach it I throw in all the history and theme from the game, deep down it is entirely abstract. Take set actions to get set results. Turn after turn. You could remove all references to history and theme and still play the game. And change the colors to just red, green, blue, black and white tiles. And then play the exact same game. None the wiser. See, for example, the original version of "Santorini" and the modern themed update.

Yes. Over Christmas we played the "demo" version (as suggested by someone on BGG) using Ticket to Tide trains as the pieces with simple printouts of plain (non-decorated) player boards. Clearly "not attractive" but still "fully functional".

Respuesta 8:
I guess this settles it?

Respuesta 9:
Paradoxically, I don't think we should use the dictionary definition of abstract for abstract games. Here are a few reasons, including some highlighted in this thread:

1. All games are abstracted to a large extent, so defining the line between abstract and thematic would be difficult.

2. Adding polish, as with a second edition, shouldn't change the classification.

3. The most helpful game classification connects games that the same person would tend to like. The most effective classification style is game mechanics. I think this is the reason why "abstract" and "abstract strategy" are often used interchangeably. Also, consider the other popular game categories.

Hence, I like to define abstract games as those with simple rules, complex strategy, low chance, and high information. I think "elegant" is a better term for the category, but "abstract" has some historical value.

As for why the misnomer of abstract originally came, I blame correlation. I think that theme is often used as a way to make up for less elegant rules. Consider removing the theme from highly thematic games and then comparing the individual core mechanics to those of an acclaimed abstract. Also, I think that simplicity in rules is often considered elegant. That simplicity in rules seems to fit well with simplicity of theme. There aren't many rules to assign thematic value anyways.

Or to put a more positive spin on it, less elegant rules are deliberately chosen with the aim of evoking/simulating a chosen setting.

Respuesta 11:
After further consideration, I still think the theme of Azul should not impact its abstract status. However, maybe the randomness due to the tile drawing should remove the abstract status. In general, I prefer terms to be narrowly defined so that they carry more meaning. Just think about how broad categories like strategy or party are. It would be helpful if abstract meant elegant/simple rules, perfect information, and and zero randomness.

Hmmm... I’m not sure less elegant mechanisms evoke more immersion. I predict immersive games simply require many... many... more mechanisms so cannot be as fine-tuned as abstracts.

I find this podcast helpful. Different gamers perfer the bulk of development time spent on different aspects (Immersion, Creativity, Action, Social, Mastery, Achievement).

Respuesta 13:
Looking at abstract from traditional definitions is the trap most people fall into when determining if a game 'is abstract'. Azul isn't, as it fails the first test of an abstract game, perfect information, followed by failing by having randomness. While every move is deterministic, draw order prevents perfect information, thereby making this a traditional/family game, but not an abstract. Theme is not even actually relevant to the discussion. Abstract is sononymous with combinatorial games.



Tema 543: How many rounds? (POLL)

Though this does appear to be somewhat related to player counts. When my wife and I play at just 2-player, easily 90+% have been 5 round games. Only a few went to 6. But at 3- and 4-player counts, interestingly a higher percentage of games go 6 rounds. I've yet to have a 7-round game, though, of course, it is possible.

Yes, this is surprising to me. I'd expect the more players in the game (and able to end the game), the less likely it would be to go greater than 5 rounds. Interesting! Maybe it's easier to know whether you're in the lead with a 2p game?

+1

That sounds near-impossible, like a hard and truly cooperative effort, trying to maximise score and avoid finishing the game as long as possible.

Respuesta 5:
Maybe it's just group think, but our group mainly goes for vertical rows and 5 of a kind, so our games almost always go past 5 rounds. Usually around 7, but I've definitely played games that went to 9 rounds, maybe even more.

Respuesta 6:
The most tiles you can place without ending the game is four in each row. To do this uses 60 tiles (1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 5 for each row). For the game to go 9 rounds, every player must have placed fewer than that in 8 rounds. But 9-10 tiled per player come into the game each round (depending on player count) so each player would have to be throwing 12-20 tiles on to the floor. Definitely feels like groupthink.

Specified:
If the game does not end after 8 rounds, then the maximum number of tiles placed in the building rows (not the wall) is 4 times (1+2+3+4+5) plus 1+2+3+4 (one tile missing in each building row in the 8th round; also one tile missing in each wall row).
That means max. 70 tiles placed in each player's building rows in 8 rounds.

Player number/nr. of tiles taken in 8 rounds/max. tiles placed on players' boards in 8 rounds (sum):

2/160/140
3/224/210
4/288/280

It 'only' means throwing 10/5/2 tiles/player on the floor.
With ideal distribution of tiles which almost never happens.
Also with no one messing with others' plans, what's more, probably helping each other quite a bit.
Also with a crazy 9th round that I can't even imagine.

9 rounds feels like some rule error is involved (e.g. 'play ends when one player fills their board completely') OR the game is played as a cooperative game where everyone tries to build a complete wall and everyone helps each other in this aim.

Tema 544: Clarification once again on multiple rows of same color
Pregunta:
This has been asked and almost answered, but I'm still not quite clear.
Say I have from a previous round, a row of 3 reds on the 4th row (ie I need one more red tile to complete that row). During the round (the set of all player turns from the start of all factory tiles full through we emptied them and can then place tiles), say I have three separate turns where I pick up red tiles (3 tiles, then 3 again, then 1). What are my legal plays?

1) I can only play them on my existing red row, meaning I play 1 of the first 3, and then the remaining 2 plus the other 3 plus the 1 all go to the floor.

2) I can play them on any one row but not more than one during the round. So I could play the first 3 on row 5, then 2 of the next 3 to fill row 5, then the 3rd of those plus the next 1 go to the floor.

3) I can play them on any row, as many different rows as I want, but only one row per turn/grabbing a set of tiles. So I could put the first 3 on row 3 (filling it) then the next set of 3 on row 2 (filling it plus one to the floor), then the last 1 onto row 4 (filling it).

4) I can put them anywhere, so I could use the first 3 to finish row 4 plus fill row 2, then the next 3 to fill row 3, then the last one to fill row 1.

I'm pretty sure it's not #1 or #4, but is it #2 or #3? Or something else I haven't considered?

Respuesta 1:
Option 3 is correct.

Item 3 would be in compliance with these two points covered in the rules (the rules use bold as shown).

Then, add the tiles you picked to one of the 5 pattern lines on
your player board...
...
If the pattern line already
holds tiles, you may only
add tiles of the same color to it.



Tema 545: Board Idea (replaces Factory Tiles and Individual Score Tracks)
Pregunta:
Here's an idea for a central board which replaces the 9 Factory Tiles and individual scoring tracks.

I trust it will be self explanatory, but you basically drop the 5, 7 or 9 batches of tiles around the blue region and register everyone's score on the perimeter track using suitable pawns. The central circular area is for unselected tiles (as usual).

Whilst I have no issue with the Factory Tiles as supplied, this idea arose from my dislike of the scoring tracks. Done privately, the tracks are prone to counting errors and are highly vulnerable to the slightest of knocks. Done centrally, the scoring is likely to be far safer and more reliable, and all scores can be seen at a glance. It therefore seemed sensible to combine the tile selection area with the new score track.

The idea lends itself nicely to either a laminated paper print or even the prospect of a home-made luxury wooden/tiled board.

I will probably need to experiment with the basic sizes and proportions, but before I do so I would be pleased to receive any comments or suggestions.

Respuesta 1:
I totally agree with you about the individual scoring tracks. I love the game, the design, the material, but I can't understand their choice of scoring tracks.
So, your idea is great !
I like the factory tiles so I don't want to replace them, but the design of your board is really nice.
You should also think about how to fit in the box.
Anyway, I'm interested.

Respuesta 2:
How do you prevent the batches of factory tiles getting accidentally mixed up if, for example, someone bumps them?

Respuesta 3:
Thank you for the comments.


This is an indication of the basic proportions that I believe would provide ample space for a 4P game. The 9 tile batches are indicated, although I do not see any need to mark their positions on the board.

The counting track squares are the same size as the tiles (19mm square), given the possibility that I might use actual Azul tiles for the score track (mounted on a wooden board). Note that the track now counts 0/60, rather than 0/40 in my original sketch. The central circle would be approximately 15cm diameter and the overall board size approximately 35x35cm, which allows for a margin around the outside of the track. Not a large board by any means, but admittedly too big for the box.

Could tile batches be accidentally knocked? Yes, but I don't see this as a significant risk, any more so than knocking the tiles on your own board.

Respuesta 4:
Will you put on the site your last version of the board ? I'd like to test it.
I also want to make tiles with fimo to use on the new scoring track (to replace black cubes).

Respuesta 5:
Here is my updated sketch, which is comfortably sized for 4P.
Sorry I don't know anything about printing scales, but you've got the right size if the actual tiles match the score track for size.

Respuesta 6:
A quick 4P setup on a full size paper print, and a few turns later.

Respuesta 7:
I like this! To eliminate ANY possible movement, you could:

1) laminate the board and use a wet erase marker.
2) imbed a metal strip around the edge before laminating and then use
small magnets.

At last, I will soon be getting around to building my Azul board. For a number of practical reasons, the plans have evolved quite a bit since my previous post.

The board will be circular (41cm dia) polished hardwood, with a decorated ceramic tile in the centre (16cm dia) and a 50 tile (2cm) mosaic scoretrack around the perimeter. The 9 batch positions will be marked with small mosaics. All decorations will be rebated into the board to achieve a smooth and flush finish. Players' score markers will be mosaics mounted on wooden bases.

A template of the final production version can be seen below. Photos of work in progress will hopefully follow.

I think the fact that so many in here are starting threads trying to find a better way to handle scoring in Azul, right down to printing mats and totally re-designing the board, strongly suggests that the current layout is flawed. It looks very nice, but it's clear to me that the scoring track is a poorly-implemented idea. Maybe if the boards had included a "raised' plastic top section, like Sagrada, that locks the scoring pieces in, so they don't go flying around with the smallest bump, it wouldn't have been an issue. There are even multiple overlays being made to try and help the situation. Personally I can say that a small bump is all it takes to send that awful scoring cube sliding a couple squares over, totally losing your score if you weren't paying very close attention to where it was.

People seem awfully defensive of this game when people have anything negative to say about it, so I'm sure I'll get some hate for this. But I know I"m not alone in this.

I am glad to see people trying to find solutions. Some of these designs are fantastic.
I'm not particularly defensive. I think you are making strong assumptions of the "so many people" thinking it's poorly designed. Of the over 200,000+ games sold I think there may be 20-30? 50? users who don't like it. While they may representative of a larger number; I think the vast majority has no issue.

Regardless, I welcome innovation, especially if it leads to further enjoyment of the game. I don't see us returning to redesign the board. Recessed boards are a good idea. Likely cheaper than the acrylic overlays, this is something that could provide players with an official product to prevent "bumping". I don't know how popular it will be with the team but it seems like it could be a fair compromise.

Respuesta 12:
A scale mock-up with some very rough colouration. The mosaic scoretrack has been reduced from 50 to 45 to harmonise the 9 factory areas. Thus in a 4P game, there's 1 batch to each red mosaic.

Also, a photo showing the relative sizes of the board features and Azul Factory Tiles. The Factory Tiles could even be placed on the board if so desired.

Tema 546: Starburst as new 1st Player Marker?!?
Pregunta:
The two things I heard most about Azul (besides the fact that it is a great game):
1) the tiles were awesome and reminded people of Starburst candy

Tema 547: Question
Pregunta:
WHO can help?
Is it allowed to place the Blue Stone there, and what happend then?

Respuesta 1:
You could add it, as it can still go in the fifth space in that row of the wall.

Respuesta 2:
From what I understand of the rules, you cannot place the single blue there because you already have a row of two blues right already placed.

Respuesta 3:
You can add the blue tile to your pattern line.

However, in the wall tiling phase you're going to bring over that single tile first, which will invalidate your 2nd row (as they cannot be placed in any column that already contains a blue tile), those 2 tiles on your second row go down to the floor.

https://boardgamegeek.com/article/27452433#27452433

"Special case: In the tile-laying phase, it may happen that you are not able to move the rightmost tile of a certain pattern line over to the wall because there is no valid space left for it. In this case, you must immediately place all tiles of that pattern line in your floor line."

Respuesta 10:
So to summarize. This is legal, but you won't be able to place both blue tiles on your wall in the tile placement phase.

It would allow you to extend the game one more turn....if you didn't place the single blue tile, the game would end as you would finish the 2nd row. That one extra turn would allow you to complete column #1 and possibly column #4 (column #3 will be completed this turn).

Also, you will get negative points for the two blue tiles you can't place on your wall.

Rich, this makes sense. First row is a legal move, but that move invalidates the second row because the only place either row can have a blue is in the fifth spot, and so the second row must be taken to the floor. Thanks.

Respuesta 12:
Jimmy, No, you can have as many rows of the same color as you wish as long as that row's wall doesn't have that color in it. In this case, placing it in the first row is a valid move but it creates a situation where the second row's blues become invalid because each COLUMN can only have one of each color in it (the only place a blue can be placed on the wall in this particular scenario is in the fifth column). The question then becomes can you make a legal move if it invalidates a prior legal move. I agree with Rich's answer that you can, but you then must move the two blue tiles down to the floor because you "process" the scoring starting from the top. (but I didn't make the game, so it is just MHO).

If that would be true, then you also couldn’t put the two blue tiles in the second row on the floor during scoring. And we’ve just learned you need to do so. That’s why I want to know, is this mandatory? I can’t find it in the rules you must place them.

But you are right when saying “I take it and then place it on the floor instead of the upper row” to bypass this. I just want to know how to process this if it occurs.

I think it's that you can't choose to put something on the floor, during the scoring phase, but if it becomes impossible to move something to its row, you then are forced to put it to the floor.

Yes, the floor is generally not meant to be used during wall-tiling. It's never mentioned in the rules of that phase except for this special case that they added in the last hour as you can see in https://boardgamegeek.com/article/27452433



Tema 548: Can you place "throw away" tiles on row with same color already placed on wall?
Pregunta:
Question probably says it all, but we got this for Christmas and had an "argument" with my middle son about this on our 3rd game.

It was the last round since someone completed a horizontal row. He'd already placed a red tile on his wall from the 4 tile row earlier in the game and ended up having to take 4 red tiles from the center. He placed them in his empty 4 tile row. I told him he couldn't do that since he'd already placed a red tile from that row on his wall earlier in the game. Since he didn't have room for them on his 1,2,3 or 5 rows, he needed to place them on his floor for negative points. He thought he should be able to since it didn't matter.

Who was correct?

Respuesta 1:
You were correct

Respuesta 2:
If I'm understanding your story correctly, then you were right. You can't place tiles in a row unless they could be legitimately moved across into your wall. He would have needed to add them to his floor.

You are not allowed to place tiles of a certain color in a pattern line whose corresponding line of your wall already holds a tile of that color.

But what if you fill the two preparation lines with the same color (let's say line 3 and 1: line 3 with two pieces in one round, then line 1 with one piece another round and then line 3 again with the last needed piece) but then you move piece 1 on the wall but cannot move line 3 first piece on the wall because of column restrictions.
Will this piece only go on the floor, or the full line?

Edit: using advanced board with no pre-filled colors.

The full line.



Tema 549: Rule clarifications
Pregunta:
Hey,

Love the game, but wanted to make sure I'm playing it correctly.

Question 1: Let's say someone has filled every row in their "staging area" with tiles, and there are still tiles left on the table when the turn gets back to them. What happens if...

1a) The person has *no colors* in their filled up staging area that match tiles in the discard pile?

1b) The person has a color in the filled up staging area that matches a color in the discard pile? (are they forced to pick up all of the tiles and add them to their floor row?)

Question 2: Once someone successfully completes a row, my understanding is that wall placement commences, but there is no final scoring of tiles (positive or negative), and instead only completed rows, columns, and sets of 5 of the same tile are scored. Did I get that right?

Respuesta 1:
If my answers seem really far from how you play it might be worthwhile to watch a video explanation.

1 - you must pickup tiles on your turn, it's your choice whether you put those on your pattern lines or the floor. If your pattern lines are full or the wrong colors then all the tiles you pickup go to the floor.

2 - wall tiling happens at the end of the round which is when all tiles have been claimed. The game ends after the wall tiling phase if someone has completed a row of 5 on their wall. So you fully score all the tiles placed in that round, then if the game end condition is met you score the bonuses and compare scores to see who won.

Respuesta 2:
Thanks for the clarifications!

Respuesta 3:
I feel like 1b wasn’t answered. I couldn’t find a prohibition against this. So if for example there is a line of red’s completely filled up and there’s more reds in the middle and an empty line then you should be able to put those reds in the line and not the floor.

Tema 550: Running out of tiles?
Pregunta:
Hi, We just played our first game tonight. In the last round we had just enough tiles to fill the 9 factories. In fact, there was only 1 tile left in the bag. If no one would have completed his first horizontal line this round, we would have had a problem.
Is it possible that you run out of tiles so that you cannot refill all factories? What to do then? Or were we playing something wrong?

Respuesta 1:
You place all the tiles back in the bag and proceed as you usually do

Respuesta 2:
I know. We filled the bag about 3 times before we were running (almost) out of tiles. Probably because all of us were playing on the verticals and all 5 tiles of one color. Even after 8 rounds, the game wasn't finished.

Respuesta 3:
It's in the rules - you just play with incomplete factory tiles.

Respuesta 4:
Thanks! Didn't see that one!

Respuesta 5:
But how do you partially fill? do you:
•put 4 on as many as you can, leaving some empty
or
•1 on each factory, then a second, third... on each until the bag is empty.

I've gotten pretty good at grabbing 4 at a time, but then had to redistribute. Which once I could see the colours was hard to do without being possibly biased or accused of bias!

the rules only say
Quote:
In the rare case that you run out of tiles again while there are none left in the lid, start the new round as usual even though not all Factory displays are properly filled.
(edited to add this quote)

Respuesta 6:
Four and a time, I'd say.

Respuesta 7:
Martin G
@qwertymartin
Four and a time, I'd say.
That's what I'd do to, four on each tile until you run out (meaning you either have one tile with less than four, or an empty tile or a combination of the two), as that is following the normal set up rules as closely as you're able.

Respuesta 8:
Thats what I'd do too. I do think this should be clarified in a future edition of the rules.

Respuesta 9:
I'd just like to add that the German rules are (just a tiny bit) clearer on this, since they omit the word "properly". So the more direct English equivalent would be "[...] even though not all Factory displays have been filled."

This suggests that you should indeed fill a single display with what remains in the bag and leave any others empty.



Tema 551: Azul - Dutch review Spelgroep Phoenix
Pregunta:
Azul

Azul is een spel van de uitgever Plan B Games. Dit spel kan met zowel 2, 3 of 4 spelers gespeeld worden. Iedereen bouwt een muur met mooie tegels in het Alhambra. En natuurlijk de meeste punten verdienen om het spel te winnen.

In het begin van het spel liggen er afhankelijk van het aantal spelers een paar ronde schijven op tafel. Op ieder van die schijven liggen 4 tegels in verschillende kleuren. Als je aan de beurt bent pak je tegels van een bepaalde kleur van een schijf, je moet wel alle tegels van je gekozen kleur pakken, dus liggen er 2 of 3 pak je die 2 of 3 en niet alleen 1 stuks. De overgebleven tegels van die schijf gaan naar het midden op tafel.

Op een gegeven moment wil of moet iemand wel de tegels uit het midden van de tafel pakken. Ook hier pak je alle tegels van die kleur die je kiest. De eerste speler die uit het midden kiest krijgt een fiche die hij neerlegt op zijn speelbordje voor -1 punt, maar hij is de volgende ronde wel startspeler.

Als een speler tegels heeft gekozen legt hij deze op zijn speelbord. Van links naar rechts moeten de rijen gevuld worden. De bovenste rij is met 1 tegel al vol, de volgende 2, 3 en de onderste rij heeft 5 van dezelfde kleur tegels nodig. Als een speler tegels heeft gepakt die hij niet op zijn bordje kan leggen komen deze in de onderste rij die iedere ronde weer voor strafpunten zorgt.

Als alle tegels van tafel zijn gepakt is de eerste ronde afgelopen en volgt er een puntentelling. Van alle verzamelde tegels mag er één, mits de rij vol is, er 1 op de muur neergelegd worden, de andere tegels gaan opzij naar de voorraad. Alle gebouwde tegels leveren 1 of meer punten op.

Aan het eind van het spel krijg je nog extra punten als je een horizontale rij tegels af hebt, zodra een speler dat heeft is het spel afgelopen en was dit de laatste ronde. Ook als je een kolom tegels af hebt of alle tegels van 1 kleur, verdien je daar extra bonuspunten mee.

Conclusie:
Ook al is iedereen aan zijn eigen muurtje aan het bouwen is het toch goed om te tegenstanders in de gaten te houden. Welke tegels pak je nu van de tafel en welke probeer je straks te bemachtigen. Soms is het ook een tactiek om je tegenspelers met veel minpunten op te zadelen.
Het is een zeer kleurrijk en vrolijk spel en nodigt zeker uit tot nog een keer spelen.

When I get warped boards, not just Azul, but many others, I put them under weight to keep them flat until they acclimate, which usually solves the problem. In the meantime or if they never lay flat, we use foam shelf liner cut to the board size, which keeps them from shifting.

Respuesta 3:
In my game it is almost unnoticably. Nothing which you cannot fix by bending slightly before you put these on the table. But currently air is really dry around here anyways.

Tema 555: Scaling problem with 2
Pregunta:
I really love this game at 2 and 4 players (haven't tried 3 yet but I assume it's just as good).
I have found a small issue with the 2 player version that isn't what most people are talking about (defensive play / "meanness"): there is scaling for the number of markets but not for the number of tiles in the bag.
In a 2 player game, it is entirely possibly, and more than likely that the bag will never cycle. There are 100 tiles and 20 put out per round. This means that 5 rounds, enough to fill a row, takes exactly 100 tiles.
In a 4 player game, the bag cycles in the 3rd round, and in a 3 player it's the 4th round.

I've had a thought to take out 5 or 10 of each tile type to make the bag cycle. I'm wondering if the game was ever play tested this way or if anyone's tried it this way. It seems to make sense to me. 50 tiles in 2 player means it cycles at the start of the 3rd round. 75 tiles in 3 player means it's cycling in the 3rd round too.

Respuesta 1:
What’s the issue if the bag cycles earlier or later in the game? What problem are you trying to correct?

Respuesta 2:
There is 20 tiles of each color, so 5 of each color for every players in 4 player game. So it seems logical to remove 5 of each color for every missing players, because anyway, you can't have more than 5 tiles of a color on your scoring board.

When I will finally get my copy, I intend to play that way (just like with Sagrada, we reduce the amount of dice based on player count).

Respuesta 3:
The issue is that when it cycles, it's easier to complete the "all of 1 kind" +10 point bonus.
In a 2 player game that ends at 5 rounds, one person has to collect 15 of 20 possible tiles to complete that bonus. If it cycles, you could get some rows done then complete more rows with the same tiles you used previously.

Respuesta 4:
I noticed the same thing, but I wouldn't call it a problem. It's just one way that it plays differently at 2.

Respuesta 5:
I've played plenty of 2 and 3 player games. Tile distribution has never been an issue. We've also cycled the bag with every 2 player game at least once. Now, if the other player is trying to cut the game short, yeah, you may not cycle the bag, but that's a possibility with higher player counts, too.

You have to watch the other players and see what their plans are to gauge what you need to concentrate on. If you see someone filling a row and they're at 4, you either need to try and grab what they need to keep them from getting it or finish out your board and hopefully max your points before they do.

There's really not a problem with the tile distribution and player count. It's directly affected by player strategy and play style to who much of each tile appears in the span of a game..

Respuesta 6:
I'm guess I'm not saying it's a "bad" game but the end of game scoring is much different and much less. In 4 player games, someone can be behind by 10-15 points and still win. The way I've seen 2 player games, it's unlikely.

We played 4 times at 2 player last night and the bag only cycled once. It's guaranteed to cycle in a 4 player game it's likely that it's cycled twice before finishing factory placement during round 5. It's a much different game.

Edit: to be clear, my wife and I LOVE Azul. The only other game we've played 4 times in one night is Biblios, our most played game.

Respuesta 7:
I'm missing the problem, since both players know it and both players can look at their own board and their opponent's board to see how far along they are in completing each of their rows.

A player that fails to advance the appropriate row(s), usually the 1 or 2 tile rows, each round puts themselves at the mercy of the other player when it comes to them ending the game. I have let it go a 6th round rather than end it in 5 when it benefitted me greatly (usually by allowing me to complete a 2nd column and usually a 2nd row

Respuesta 8:
@Wildhorn
you can't have more than 5 tiles of a color on your scoring board.
Are you also considering any rows on the left side that may have more than one with the same color tiles?

Respuesta 9:
I actually like how it plays differently at 2, compared to 3 or 4, because of the likelihood that you only go through the bag once. (In my ten 2-player games we rarely went more than 5 rounds since it's so easy to complete the top two rows.) Different strategies are employed since you can count how many tiles are left in each color. It's like a different flavor of ice cream on the same cone. Both enjoyable, just unique ways of enjoying the same game.

Let's say you just take 10 of each color. If you try to complete a color, you have placed already 3or 4 tiles of this color and for a next cycle the number of tiles of this color is reduced compared to other colors. This makes it again a bit harder to complete it in comparison to having a larger pool of 20 tiles.

It certainly scales a bit differently across player numbers. I also think it is easier with 4 players to avoid minus points (possbily due to the 2n+1 number of factories).

I am pretty sure that the designers intended to design a family game. For this it is better to have some differences in player scaling (differences does not mean that one way is better or worse) than to to count the number of tiles always during setup. In the end, I can imagine that the game plays perfectly well if you reduce 4 or 5 tiles of each color for every player less than 4. Anybody who thinks there is a problem can try this out.

Respuesta 11:
Playing differently at different player counts is normal, often impossible to avoid, and generally a good thing. Scores from 2P and multiplayer usually vary.

You have observed a 'thing' not a 'bad thing'. This is not a problem, would would you want to do anything about it? Leave it as it is, it's working as intended.

Respuesta 12:
This thread badly needs a new title. Nobody (including the OP) has identified a problem.

Respuesta 13:
Played 2 games yesterday with 2 players. We played both way, with all the tiles and by removing half of each color.

Half: The bag cycle alot (a good thing) and it makes gameplay more competitive.

Full: The bag will not cycle. So you better be counting the tiles that already got out if you do not want to be stuck with uncompletable lines due that all the tiles of a color already been drawn.

I prefered by far playing with only half of tiles.

Respuesta 14:
I played 2p for the first time the other day (with the regular rules) and *loved* that you can track the tiles that have gone (we just left them all out on the side of the board).

Tema 560: Variant: Same tile more than once in a wall row
Pregunta:
Hi, when playing the variant, it says in the rule book that no color can appear more than once in a wall column. But, what about in a row? For example, can I have two red tiles in the same wall row?

I would think not because the variant rules state "Rules are exactly the same as in the normal game...", which suggests that I wouldnt be able to place red tiles in a pattern line that already has a red tile in the wall.

Tema 562: For those that have played with the Joker Tiles
Pregunta:
How do you feel about them? Do they improve the game? Is it significant? Are they fun to play with? Are they worth purchasing?

Respuesta 1:
I personally feel that what they add to tile placement options is negatively outweighed by what they take away from end game scoring. I've only played with them once or twice so my opinion may not be that relevant. I could totally be missing some strategy that playing with them makes possible.

Respuesta 2:
I've played the game four times now and they have never hit the table. I think they might this weekend though. I've had people say, "I'd like to play with those", but when push comes to shove, we just play the base game on the standard side of the board. I'll report back when they get used.

Respuesta 3:
Ive played 8 games of Azul, the last one with the Jokers (just got them this week). Don't know if I like them or not, but will probably use them for another game or two before deciding. They do add a bit more decision-making. I used three of them, and another player (4-player) didn't use any. He and I tied for the win. If you want to get the 10 bonus points for 5 of a color, you need to be careful as the jokers do not count for the 5-of-a-color bonus. So, choose which color you want to get all five of, and DON"T use a joker for that. They might add a little more strategy, but I'd have to play it more to offer a hardened opinion about them.

Respuesta 4:
I like to use one of my joker tiles as a replacement 1st player tile when not actually playing with them.

Respuesta 5:
Think it is very subjective. I enjoy both their play and the added variability, including their use on both boards. BUT my wife hates them. So I don't get to use them in our 2-player games but only in the 3- or 4-player games at my weekly large gaming group.

Well I'm trying to gauge wether or not I even want to buy them, is the thing.

Respuesta 7:
I have them but haven't tried them yet. A gaming buddy felt there was an element of luck of the draw with tiles on the factory displays, and we thought perhaps the wild tiles might mitigate some of that luck.

Respuesta 8:
I've played 9 games so far, about half of them with joker tiles. If you play on the player boards with the predefined colors, I think you'll find the joker tiles tend to take away points. They make hard choices for sure. If you make sparing use of them, they can certainly help in a pinch, but they'll remove that 10 vp bonus.

However, when played on the reverse side of the board, they are invaluable, and you basically want them at all costs. On this board side, you can very easily block yourself from being able to play certain colors. The jokers however don't contribute to that, allowing you to much more easily get bonuses.

Overall, I'm glad I have them. If someone is brand new (to gaming in general), I might not use them, but I'd use them in most other cases.

Tema 564: What's the deal with the first player token?
Pregunta:
As in when you pick up the 1st player token does it count as a tile for negative points or not? The rules text kinda implied it does, but the example says otherwise. I've seen people on reviews say it does count and I'm now very confused.

Respuesta 1:
When you take tiles from the center and the first-player tile is still in the center, it is taken with your selected tiles and immediately goes to your floor row.

Respuesta 2:
The rules (p. 3) clearly say to place it in your floor line:

Quote:
If you are the first player in this round to pick tiles from the center of the table, also take the starting player marker and place it onto the leftmost free space of your floor line.
The example right next to that shows a player taking the starting player marker and placing it on a floor space. And a scoring example on p. 5 shows a player getting negative points for tiles AND the starting player marker in his floor line...

So, no, I don't see any reason for confusion.

Respuesta 3:
I see what the problem was. I read it as the penalty was the number of tiles times the number above the right most tile so in the example 4 tiles times -2 equals the 8. Where it is actually you just add up the numbers above the tiles and the token. Thanks for clearing that up!



Tema 565: Tile Placement to Maximize Points
Pregunta:
AB
CD

I notice that placing tiles A and C on turn one then B and D on turn two produce 9 points. But placing A and D on turn one then B and C on turn two produce 10 points. (Two tiles score horizontal and vertical instead of just one.)

Is there a general rule for maximizing points earned from placement (assuming you can always get the colors/placement you want)? Maybe: Build a diagonal on your first turn then fill in around it on subsequent turns.

There will always be limitations due to available tiles. My question is focused on the ideal situation where you can get the tiles you want. What placement pattern should I want?

Respuesta 1:
Looks like you discovered (or stumbled upon) a generalized pattern that answered your own question. 10 > 9, so with all other things being equal, go for the pattern that gives you 10 (assuming you get that second turn that fills, otherwise don't)!

Respuesta 2:
I am interested in something generalized that would also apply to a 3x3 and 4x4 and, most importantly, a 5x5 that won't end up getting filled completely. There might not be a simple answer.

My initial conclusion was "It's only a point or two. Good technique requires thinking about it, but really, you'll get more bang for your buck by working on other facets of the game. Like maybe paying more attention to your opponents' boards."

But a quick moment thinking of examples in the 3x3 case shows otherwise. The range is in fact fairly large. Rather than trying to work out a methodical system of analysis, I wrote a simple program to see what the results were. Raw data might help the smarter among you to see a pattern.

The scores ranged from 22 to 33. Here are samples. Frequencies are raw percentages making no attempts to categorize by symmetries or the like. Rounding errors yadda yadda.

Neither surprises.

I note that good old

or more realistically, from a game play perspective,

ADG

is right near the top. Maybe less thinking and more scoring is the answer.

Respuesta 7:
In general, you want to maximise the number of times you make a horizontal and a vertical line with the same placement as the tile you are placing then counts twice.

The 33-pointer does this with 6 of the 9 tiles placed. The 22 pointer with only 1!

Respuesta 8:
I believe there is value performing an analysis on cases where you place a tile in each row every turn. So, in the 3x3 case.
A - In the top row
B - In the 2nd row
C - In the 3rd row
D - In the top row
E - In the 2nd row
...

This may indicate you are correct about this being a marginal consideration with other aspects of the game being significantly more important.

Respuesta 9:
Perhaps this is obvious to folks already, but one solid strategy is that when placing tiles, it is better to place them as close to the center column as possible, and avoid initially investing at the ends.


-□---□---□---□---□
-□---□---□---□---□
-□---□---□---□---□
-□---□---□---□---□
-□---□---□---□---□

This allows for greater flexibility, because you can add to either side of your initial placement. Where as starting at the ends means you only have one direction of expansion to score additional points, and other players can more easily deny you the tiles you want.

Definitely makes sense, though I think the OP is looking at this at an angle of theoretical math/thought experiment.

Respuesta 11:
Not the original poster, and sure, theoretical math is one perspective. Not an odd one for me to take up given my background.

But my real interest here is in game design. Why was this scoring method chosen? What properties does it have which make it interesting? What actions in other parts of the game are driven by details in how scoring works? Would the game be improved with a different scoring method?

The properties here are, of course, numerical/theoretical math. Some of them are. Other ones are things like "how easy is this to teach?". BTW: the one chosen doesn't do very well in the easy to teach metric. For such a rules-light game, new players consistently score tile placements incorrectly.

Respuesta 12:
Dave Eisen
@dkeisen
..."how easy is this to teach?". BTW: the (scoring rule)chosen doesn't do very well in the easy to teach metric. For such a rules-light game, new players consistently score tile placements incorrectly.
The "bonus" point when pieces are horizontally and vertically adjacent to the tile played seems not very material. Would it be simpler to teach/learn and play without the bonus point? A tile's score would equal the number of tiles in its group, looking horizontally and vertically.

Respuesta 13:
I've only played once, but here's a thought on a totally different aspect of the game: the end game bonus.

You get a lot by completing a column. (7)
You get a lot by completing a tile color. (10)
The fifth row is the most difficult to complete.

Therefore, try to complete a column and a color which share the same tile in the fifth row.

The next time I play, I'm going to see how opportunities develop in the first round or two. From there, I'm going to try choosing a particular column I think I'm most likely to be able to complete. Whatever tile color is in the bottom row is the color I'll also try to complete for ten points.

Respuesta 14:
Yep, that's pretty much been my strategy!

Respuesta 15:
What makes this game shine for me is the color restrictions and interacting with opponents. Colors drain from the pool based on the players - are they holding over to complete the bottom 5? What is available this round in the factories? What has already come out of the bag?

So calculating maximum score is based on the game state!

Respuesta 16:

notice how the 2x2 grid is inside the 3x3 grid and so on
the diagonal extension dont have to be in the same direction as the previous diagonal

Respuesta 17:
@jy: Yeah, I think you're basically right. I think the score for 4x4 is 76 (not 96) though. And the score for 5x5 is 145. The max score for an NxN grid seems to be: N^3 + N^2 - N.

A slightly more general, flexible way to phrase your rule might be: As long as you fill in all spaces closer to the main diagonal (on the same side of the main diagonal, including the main diagonal) before filling in a spot X, then you'll achieve the maximum score. You can find many such solutions that give you 76, for example:

AEHJ
KBFI
NLCG
POMD

All that said, as people above have mentioned, these max scores assume the board gets entirely filled in (which won't happen) and what matters more is how to turn this into the best game strategy, which depends on game state and player interactions. So the game is not solved, and your tactical skill still matters! =)

Also, to echo Dave's point above, I'm curious why this scoring mechanism was created from a game design perspective. Not saying it isn't reasonable. I could believe that remembering a single isolated piece is worth 1 point (rather than 2 points, one for the column and one for the row) is easier to remember. And it does change the strength of various strategies, which is legitimate.


Extra challenge: Find the minimum achievable score with a NxN grid entirely filled in.

Respuesta 18:
For reference here's quick rundown of efficiencies

HxV---Spent--Placed--Points--Pts/Spt--Pts/Plc
3x3---18------9--------33-------1.83------3.67
2x5---30------10-------51------1.70------5.10
4x4---40------16-------96------2.40------6.00
3x5---45------15-------87------1.93------5.80
5x3---30------15-------77------2.56------5.13


Filling out the bottom 3 rows gives 77 points for 30 tiles used up, which is slightly more efficient than 4x4, which is in turn more efficient than a 3x5 in every way.

The thing is, vertical columns (7 pts) or diagonal strips (10 pts) grant sizable points that are granted regardless of placement order. By comparison squares (no endgame pts) and horizontal rows (2 pts) have little insurance. If you are assuming perfect placement efficiency then squares and horizontal rectangles are better, but its hard to achieve that kind of efficiency without luck or making sacrifices in total tiles placed and negative VP hits. The more vertical layouts also make full use of all possible tile slots, while the square and horizontal rectangle neglect the 4th and 5th slot rows.

Letters that are adjacent are in adjacent squares on the board. It doesn't matter where they are on the board. A tile placed next to another tile is 2 points regardless of where they are on the board.

Ah, I don't think what I was asking was conveyed properly

I meant, seeing people talk about their scores as in the post below yours,

ADI

How does that relate to the tiles that we use?

Does the alphabet play across like

ABCDE
FGHIJ
KLMNO
PQRST
UVWXY

Where the letters match up to the 5x5 wall grid on the right side of the board?

Respuesta 23:
No the alphabet conveys the order the tiles were placed and the grid shows their configuration. The position on the board of that 3x3 square is irrelevant to the score.

Respuesta 24:
In general, you should never place a tile that only score in one direction (row or column)
Either the tile is alone or it marks online and in columns!



Tema 566: Why the price gouging online?
Pregunta:
Why is this game so expensive on Ebay and Amazon? On the Plan B website it is in stock and available for the MSRP. The game is available at my FLGS for regular price. Was it out of stock recently and prices haven't adjusted yet?

Respuesta 1:
Because someone browsing ebay will see it and use their ebay gift card, ebay coupon, or just not know how to google the game and pay extra for it.

Respuesta 2:
And there are some folks who shop Amazon who I suspect don't know to look
at on line game stores like MiniatureMarket or CoolStuff to get better pricing on many games.

Respuesta 3:
It's called supply and demand.

Respuesta 4:
If you check out the other thread on this forum, apparently only one distributor has the game, thus making it hard to find in some places if a local game store doesn't have an account with that distributor (GTS).

It is out of stock at the OLGS sites, so unless you know it's available from the publisher, buyers might think it is scarce. It's also expensive to get from Plan B, the shipping is high to some places.

Plan B does have the extra tiles, however, which no one else does. It's $9 plus shipping for those.

This seems to be one of those weird situations where the game isn't that rare, but consumers have the impression that it is due to spotty distribution. Amazon has a very sophisticated way of adjusting prices for market trends -- which it seems to me why you can find prices all over the board for stuff, overpriced for rare things and ridiculously low for others, like Queen games.

It's also getting an amazing amount of hype, which drives prices up if people can't immediately find it at their usual online or local stores.

I believe we are sold at distributor level in the US. This is likely what's driving up pricing. Great reviews and player experiences has fueled the excitement and hype for the game.

That being said, we do ship pretty quickly to the US from Canada and some inventory remaining.

Best of luck everyone! A reprint is in progress, but I don't have a delivery date yet (it'll be in 2018)

Similarly, a lot of people know what to expect and only will shop online with Amazon regardless of the price point. Sellers know this and if they don't mind sitting on stock, seem to eventually sell the game at the price point that they want.

I’m guessing price is going to go up more before it goes down again. When I was in Miniature Market on Monday, I asked if I could buy the display and she said I could get a copy from the warehouse.

Tema 567: Solo variant
Pregunta:
We would to share our solo variant that me and my friends have play-tested for a while We're not English native speaker so if the rule isn't clear, kindly inform me (I've added some example images to show how we play in this solo mode.)

What you need for solo mode:
- Five D6 dice with the same color with tile (Black, Orange, Red, Blue and Light Blue)

Setup:
- Setup as 2 players gameplay except you don’t need to setup player mat for the AI player.
- You’re the first player

How to play:
- You play your turn the same way as the official rule.
- Before the 1st AI’s turn, randomly pick a dice out and roll the rest 4 dice.
- Sort all 4 rolled dice from lowest to highest value. If any of them are the same value, roll that group again till they show different value and put them back to the dice row.
- These 4 rolled dice represent the sequence of tile’s color that AI will discard from factory from turn 1st to 4th
- Check the 1st dice’s color, AI will discard tile with same color from a factory by these conditions:
----- Factory that have the least amount of tile in that color will be chosen first. AI discard those tiles of that color. The rest tiles are moved to the center of the table as usual.
----- If multiple factories are tied - use face value of the dice and count those factories clockwise. Discard tile of that color from the last one (Remember: you don’t count the group of tiles in the center of table)
- Game will continue like this until AI discard tile that matched with the 4th dice. The next turn AI will get back to focus on dice 1st, 2nd, 3rd, 4th…. and so on.
- Whenever there is no tile left in every factory or the AI can’t discard any tile from factory (e.g. you have taken them all or they were moved to the center). Roll the 5th dice and put it at the middle of the dice roll. AI will now can discard tile that match 5th dice color including from the center of the table. If AI is the first player who take the 1st player marker. You gain 1 point immediately.
- In case that you take the 1st player marker, you put it on your floor line as usual then add the 5th dice to the middle of dice row. From now on, AI counts the center of the table as a factory number as well.
- Continue until there is no tile left on table. Score your point as usual.
- The player that take 1st player marker will start the next round

End of the game:
1. AI wins - if you spend all tile from bag and you can’t complete at least one horizontal line of 5 consecutive tiles on your wall
2. You win - whenever you have completed at least one horizontal line of 5 consecutive tiles on your wall. All remained tiles in bag will count as your point as well (2 tiles = 1 point)

Make game more difficult (Select one from these conditions):
- You must accomplish both horizontal and vertical line of 5 consecutive tiles on your wall before your spend all tile from bag
- You must accomplish at least one horizontal line of 5 consecutive tiles and lay 5 tiles of the same color on your wall before your spend all tile from bag

Respuesta 1:
These solo rules look pretty interesting, thank you for your efforts with this

I don't own Azul (yet), so I'm hoping someone who tries this out can give some impression of how it plays!

Respuesta 2:
Am I missing something or would this easily be won after 5 rounds with just taking 1 tile of a color each round to score in the top row?

Respuesta 3:
You didn't missed anything It's our intention to make the game end at the 5th round easily first.

Why? - It's because there is no way to start the 6th round as you will always run out of tiles in the bag after 5th.

But now it's time to add more victory conditions to your gameplay

Respuesta 4:
Hi
First thanks for offering the solo variant.

I'm a little confused with this scoring rule:
"All remained tiles in bag will count as your point as well (2 tiles = 1 point)".

Since the solo game always end after 5th round,
and I can't see the possibility that a player
can finish a horizontal line before 5th round.
Why will there be any tile left in the bag ?

Respuesta 5:
Thank you for sharing your solo variant.
I have a few questions:

1- why do you put the 5th die in the middle of the dice row?
2- why to score or subtract points if your goal is to complete rows/columns/colors?

Thanks

Respuesta 6:
The 5th die represents unwanted tie color of the AI. You can use this mechanic to plan ahead and the 5th die added to dice roll will creates additional tie taking dynamic than put all dice in the roll from starting.

I know you have gone above and beyond to give great customer service personally answering issues on BGG -- and your company is lucky to have you.

I'm more concerned about the general issue, the use of BGG as a way to either rally the troops around a perceived wrong or otherwise strongarm a publisher/designer/flgs/folgs into resolving one side of a story to someone's satisfaction -- to the point that they post again to say, "all is well," so the "offender" don't get any further bad press.

Again, you guys have been fantastic, I'm just questioning why people think BGG should be customer service. Unless they're expecting someone to be swayed by some bad publicity because, after all, all the anonymous on BGG needs to react to is half a story.

Tema 571: 1st Player Token FYI
Pregunta:
Just an FYI...
We wish to remind fans that the start player marker can be located in the corner of one of the punchboards included in the game. We recommend that players examine the punchboards carefully before discarding them so that you don’t accidentally displace the start player marker.

Respuesta 1:
Have you had a few customer issues on that? Next print-run add some text on the punchboards.

Punch this out too!

Respuesta 2:
Since apparently so many people seem to miss this when punching the boards (don't ask me how), I'd suggest possibly adding a big arrow to it on the punchboard itself for future printings. Yeah, new printing plates and all that, but you have the space on the board. Plus it'll probably save you guys further hassle down the line.

As it is now, it's far less likely to get scooped up with the other floor tiles and tossed into the box lid (or discard cup or whatever you use).

Of course the nice insert has the special spot just for this piece! Under the one pile of Factory Displays. Where it resides nicely during transport.

Respuesta 6:
Bold reminder text would definitely be helpful. I missed the token because I didn't play the game for a few days after it arrived, and had thrown out the trash by the time I noticed it wasn't in the box.

I posted this on another thread, but more people will probably see this one - I ended up making a custom graphic the same size that looked close to the original tile, printing it out on some glossy photo paper, and gluing it to foam board. For people who like a thicker tile for the token, you could do something similar with the actual token:

I think the token is the same size as the tiles so that it can fit on the bottom of the player board (the floor section). It would be odd if it overlapped the number values or other boxes.

Ah. We found the token to punch out, but totally missed the rule about putting it on the floor. We passed it around like a normal first player token.

Respuesta 16:
It's really to overlook that token as its in the corner without a prominent border. Beige on white cardboard doesn't stand out.

I contacted the company about my "missing component" the same day I purchased the game.
I received NO REPLY.
I didn't look here because sometimes a piece is missing and not 'overlooked.'

For that, I do fault their customer service. Had I seen an answer in 2-3 days, the cardboard would have still been available to punch.

At a Secret Santa exchange, two people received this game and a game designer pointed to the corner and told us about people tossing it out. That's how I found out it wasn't going to be replaced as a missing component.

The company made a mistake by not giving it a more prominent border. In the corner it just looks like a sheet number.

NOT OBVIOUS AT ALL.

Tema 572: Tile motives durability?

I'm interested in this game, but I'm wondering about the durability of the motives in some tiles. To those that played a lot, have you noticed some form of wear?

Tema 573: Too many tiles on the floor?

It did happen two days ago in a 4-player game... One of the players was cornered into picking up too many tiles he couldn't place, and they went crashing to the floor.



Any suggestion for how many negative points to score? We went with -3 for each extra tile, but is there any "official" suggestion? Is the player immediately kicked out of the game, having pissed off Manuel I so badly that he orders his head cut?

The rules have this to say:

Quote:
If all spaces of your floor line are occupied, return any further fallen tiles to the lid of the game box to store them for now.

Yeah, the cap for negatives in one round is -14. Which is a relief sometimes!

Respuesta 3:
The rules say:
Quote:

I would interpret this as: you can never get more than -14 for the seven tiles on the floor; any additional tile will not drop your score further -- you are likely not going to win that game anyway

Tema 575: Thoughts from The Yellow Meeple:- Azul
Pregunta:
Game: Azul

Publisher: Plan B Games

Designer: Michael Kiesling

Year: 2017

Originally Posted at http://thegameshelf.blogspot.co.uk/2017/11/Yellow-Meeple-Azu...




Azul is the latest game from Plan B Games, who brought us the hotly anticipated Century Spice Road earlier this year. Century Spice Road was definitely a solid first game from this new offshoot of publisher ZMAN Games/F2Z and their follow up game has also been eagerly awaited due to the eyes on this new publisher, as well as the heavy hitting designer on the box - Michael Kiesling. Azul has a very eye-catching box, but does a good game await you inside?

In Azul you are a tile laying artist, creating your artwork on the walls of the Royal Palace of Evora. Each turn, tiles will be avilable in one of the factories in the centre of the table. You must take all of the tiles of one type from one factory and the rest of the tiles from that factory are placed in the centre of the table. You may alternatively take all of the tiles of one type from that central pile. You must then place the tiles into a single pattern row on the board - if you have too many tiles then you drop some on the floor. You continue to take turns taking tiles until all tiles have been taken from the factories and centre of the table.

In the next phase you move tiles onto your wall and score points. You push a tile from a finished pattern line into its respective spot on the same horizontal row of the wall. Points are scored for the number of tiles in the horizontal and vertical line into which you place the tile. So, if you are putting a tile in a completely isolated spot it would score just one point, but it's possible to score very high points for a good placement, adjacent to many tiles. If you haven't completed a pattern line then the tiles in it remain for you to continue on the next turn. The game continues in this way until one player triggers the end of the game by completing a horizontal line on their wall.

You should collect a respectable number of points during the game, so long as you don't lose too many points by taking too many tiles and dropping lots on the floor. However, you should also take care to score well in end game scoring, by completing rows of 5, columns of 5 or completing sets of 5 of the same coloured tile. Some of these strategies are incompatible because columns have unique tiles, with no matches, but getting 5 of a kind seems to be a good strategy to help you win the game.

I went into Azul with some caution. Abstract strategy games are normally something that I avoid playing with Amy because her mind is just better suited to that style of game. However, Azul surprised me, because it has none of the movement aspects that I find so difficult in abstract games. That said, when we're playing with two players, Amy definitely has the upper hand, so I would personally rather play with 3 or 4 players. This adds slightly less predicatability to the game as it's harder to predict the effect of your move through a chain of more players in order to line up your next turn. This suits me, because I often struggle to make these predictions, whilst Amy excels at them in a 2-player game.

The first thing that's apparent with Azul is the production quality. Its tiles are inspired by moorish tiles found in Spain and Portugal and the bakelite-type material they are made of has been printed on both sides to give a lovely look to the tiled wall you are creating. It's definitely an abstract game, but there are still some thematic tie ins, especailly with the mechanic of dropping tiles on the floor if you take more than you need.

This game could have been made with much lower production quality for a much lower price point and perhaps that would make it a bit more accessbile to a family audience. It's definitely a family weight game and I can see it working particularly well with parents or grandparents because of that quality and also the familiarity of an abstract game. My mum definitely gave it a seal of approval and it's similarity with the scoring mechanisms of Qwirkle, as well as some of the ideas of splitting piles, from games like Animals on Board, helped to make a game with a few moving parts, understandable for someone not very familiar with new board games.

Azul is a great mutliplayer abstract game, which I think has the opportunity to become a timeless classic board game. It's quality helps to give it the gravitas of an heirloom game and I hope that we'll be playing it with our family at gatherings over the next few years. Perhaps is isn't a game that will get our friends excited at game night, but its one that works for gaming in a different area of our lives and for that, the Yellow Meeple gives Azul a 7.5/10.

Respuesta 1:
I think if the production levels were lowered for a cheaper price point less people would have bought it.

I am happy that it is top notch and recognise it’s more expensive in the UK.

Respuesta 2:
Timeless classic is exactly where I think it will land as well. It fits one of my favorite profiles: simple mechanics, simple bits, ease of set-up, short play-time, and subtle strategy. Now - I do love games that offer complex bits, boards, and mechanics (Scythe, Great Western Trail, Terraforming Mars, Concordia, Terra Mystica, Power Grid come to mind), but as I age, the simple/subtle gets more plays. Thus, Attika and Azul have that enduring factor that will keep them in my game collection and frequently on my game-table, as long as I play games.



Tema 576: Can you intentionally trash a tile?

The description of the factory offer phase, the first phase of each round, starts with:

The starting player places the starting player marker in the center of the table and then takes the first turn.

The starting player marker is taken each round by whomever is the first to draft tiles from the center of the table.

Respuesta 2:
Each round, whoever first chooses from the centre pile takes the first player marker, adds it to their floor and will then be first player next round, at which point they will add it to the centre for someone to take the following round.

From the rules

"Pick all tiles of the same color from the center of the table.
If you are the first player in this round to pick tiles from the
center of the table, also take the starting player marker and
place it onto the leftmost free space of your floor line."

After scoring:



"Note: If you have the starting player
marker in your floor line, it counts as a normal tile there. But
instead of placing it in the lid, place it in front of you."

Then we're back to

"The starting player places the starting player marker in the
center of the table and then takes the first turn. Play then
continues clockwise."

Respuesta 3:
So if you are First Player at the start of the game as in the last player to visit Portugal or whatever method you choose to pick a First Player, do you get a negative 1 point at the end of that first round or do you simply place the First Player marker inside of the circle of factories to start the game?

I find this sequence in the rules. Page 2, in the "Game Setup" section, the Start Player takes posession

5. The player who most recently visited Portugal takes the
starting player marker (F) and then fills each Factory
display with exactly 4 tiles randomly drawn from the bag.


The accompanying diagram shows item F placed beside the player board. Not on the Floor line.

In the "Game Play" section on page 3, the marker moves to the center of the table.


A. Factory offer
The starting player places the starting player marker in the
center of the table and then takes the first turn.



Tema 579: Those damn joker tiles…
Pregunta:
Long story short, I wanted those joker tiles, and since you can only get them through the Plan B shop I thought, well… why not support the company and order Azul from there as well.

I currently live in Germany but I always buy my games in English, so it made sense anyway (no stock in UK at the time).

Big mistake.

First, the game. 40 USD (~34 EUR). Not too bad…
Second, joker tiles. 9 USD (~7,50 EUR). Fine…
Third, shipping. 24,50 USD (~20,50 EUR) What? (perhaps import tax is included?)

Spent some time convincing myself that it was still worth it at 62 EUR. Placed the order.
Received the game within a week. Did not expect such fast delivery. Mind blown!
Well, that was it I thought, until a few weeks later… it wasn’t.

Got an invoice from Fedex.

Import Tax. 11,32 EUR (was kinda expecting it).
Additional cost to Fedex for pre-paying the Import tax: 12,50 EUR + 2,38 EUR VAT.

Total price for Azul + joker tiles: 88,20 EUR (~104,50 USD).

Well, there is no one to blame here but the idiot that is me. I don’t even use the joker tiles. They are pretty though…

It could be even worse than that. On Oct. 19th I ordered Century Golem with the playmat and added the joker tiles (I was waiting on reviews to order the game). I still haven't received any of it and after weeks of trying I can't get a response from Plan B through email, website, or PayPal.

I did get a $92 lesson to avoid Plan B in the future. Hopefully PayPal will refund my purchase.

It sucks because both games look great.
Please contact me, I am not CSR but I will work to figure out what's going on. I am eager to help!

I was advised Joker tiles wouldn’t go retail, so ordered from Plan B direct, before Essen.

Didn’t buy the game as the same would have happened to me. Customs charge their amount, usually reasonable but Royal mail’s storage charge for sitting on a shelf is usually double the customs charge! With P&P on top for it to be sent, I just couldn’t justify it.

Got the game from an online retailer which arrived a while after the jokers as I think their was a delay in product after Essen.

I feel your pain but that’s why I almost never buy anything from the other side of the Atlantic.

I was perhaps a bit too optimistic. I purchased the Oniverse games (Onirim, Sylvion, Castellion & Nautilion) from the US a couple of months earlier for 130 USD with shipping and import tax included. By far a better deal.

I will get over it eventually though. The game is pretty fun and oh so pretty.

Tema 580: Why Best with 2?

I could see 3 moves away that I had won or lost. That bothered me about the game. With more players, it would be less likely for this to happen given the 3rd's needs.

I don't think its best with 2. Seems like 3 is the best for this game. Thoughts?

I've read 2 is more cutthroat of a game where it's more about trying to ditch the other person with extra tiles. it's easier to keep track of what one other person is doing, so easier to know what to do to make their life more difficult. Little harder to do with more people.

Depends on what type gaming experience you enjoy. I've enjoyed it repeatedly at both 2 and 4 counts. My wife & I love it. BUT it is so mean a game at 2 player. And there tends to be a run-away leader issue if the other person does great on their first two turns. These games have always gone just 5 rounds. Last time we played it she stuck me with 5 unuseable pieces on the last round. So I had huge negatives! And, of course, I've done the same to her.

Seems so much harder to do anything like that in the 4-player game. A totally different gaming experience. Much less "mean" and more "thinky" as you watch the other players on their turn and try to calculate what is best for you on your turn.

Oddly, I have yet to play it at 3. But I will.

My experience with 2 players depends more on the players than the player count. Against my gamer friend it's quite tense. It's a tightrope walk deciding what tiles to take. With two competitive players the decisions can be tense as you want to get your best score, while denying your opponent. Since you don't know what your opponent will do, zig or zag, you have to try to anticipate. Sometimes even bluffing.

Against my wife it's a very similar game to the one you described. Not anywhere near as cutthroat a game as with my gamer friend.

So I guess, depending on the play style of those playing, the game can be played wide open or very close.

In my experience anyway.

I like tight in your face games. Just played again with one other and the moment the tiles came out in the last turn I knew I had lost.

Tema 581: Team / Big 2p variant
Pregunta:
It's a game variant for:
– preventing kingmaking in 4p games (player after weakest player has the best chances to win), and
– for more complex 2p games.

In 4p team play team mates are sitting across each other. They make turns clockwise. In 2p game every player has 2 boards, and makes his turns according the next diagram.



Players use 7 Factory displays filled with exactly 5 tiles randomly drawn from the bag.

During his turn player picks tiles from any one Factory display or from the center of the table. After that, before moving remaining tiles to the center of the table:
– in 4p game his teammate picks tiles from the same place (Factory display or the center of the table),
– in 2p game player picks tiles from the same place for his second board.

Communications between the partners don't allowed.

In the end of the game team or player with the highest the lowest scoring board is the winner.

Respuesta 1:
Sounds great! I would suggest a scoring variant where only the lowest scoring board for each team would count. Thus removing the likelihood that a team just dumps garbage onto one board while only focusing on the other. It would create a more balanced approach to the decision making. It would also reduce the risk of a tie game. If scores are tied with this method, the tie breaker could then be whomever scored higher on both boards combined. And only after that, would there be a true tie.

It says in a 2 player games the player takes tiles from the same place for their second board. What if there are only tiles of one color in the center of the table and the player takes them for his first board. There would be no tiles left for the player to take for their second board. Is the player restricted from taking them initially since he can't make 2 picks from the same place in this situation?

Respuesta 5:
If there are no tiles of other color, yon don't take anything for the second board.

And you MUST take tiles, if there are any. Even for your negative score.

I understand your turn order. The 2 player order is the same as the 4 player order, but the numbering you used makes it look different and a bit confusing. If you simply swap the 2p names of B2 & B1 (and keep the arrows the same) then the turn order for 2p is the same as the 4p game.
So, for 2p, starting at A1 going clockwise, the numbering should be A1, A2, B1, B2. Then when people follow your arrows, it will be A1-B1-A2-B2, which is exactly the same numbering as your 4p version.

I hope this helps.

Respuesta 15:
I have a few comments & questions:
1.
Igor Larchenko
@Pard
– preventing kingmaking in 4p games (player after weakest player has the best chances to win)
It’s a minor point, but giving a player the best chance to win because they follow the weakest player is not kingmaking. Kingmaking is where there are two or more players who could win and a different player who has no chance of winning plays in such a way as to essentially choose which of the others will win.

What your variant does do is to allow a particularly weak player to be (hopefully) paired with the strongest player so as to balance out the strength differences.

My question for 4p is:
2. How does this variant prevent a player (or team) from getting the best advantage if they still follow a weak player?

3. Why are the factory displays arranged with one in the middle of the circle? Is it just a handy graphic you used, and really intend for all seven to be in a full circle as normal? I’m assuming this is the case, as your instructions say to fill all seven with 5 tiles each, so the centre display can’t be a placeholder for the remaining tiles to be tipped. If they should all be in a circle of 7, is it possible you could change the graphic to show this?

4. Why have you chosen to have 5 tiles per display? Is it to reduce the possibility of getting a display with all 5 the same colour? Is it to lengthen the game as this variant would otherwise shorten the game? Something else?

5. If a team mate does take all of one colour, leaving nothing for the 2nd team mate to take without penalty, does this keep things fair? In the original game players are forced to take something every turn, which encourages tactic to either avoid this or to force an opponent into that situation. Is there an alternative that can give the 2nd player a consequence?
Eg. slide all floor tiles 1 place to the right. If no tiles on floor, place a marker in 1st spot. If the floor is full... leave as is - the poor player has had enough negatives.

6. Could I suggest to make the diagonal arrows on 2p point all the way to the player for clarity? At first I thought it was trying to indicate something had to be put in the middle.

I think your two variants are quite interesting. Thanks for creating them.

Tema 583: Multiple rows with the same color on left
Pregunta:
Hi,

So, is it legal to have multiple rows on the left side with the same color as long as there is not that color in that row on the right side? For instance, say I have a row on the left side of 3 red. Then, I decide to make the two row red also. These are on seperate turns. So, I am not putting tiles on multiple rows the same turn. I am not saying that. But, can you have a red on the two row, and the three row before the round ends where you move the color tile to the right? It seems that shouldn't be legal. But, I couldn't find clarification on that.

Respuesta 1:
Yes, you can start multiple rows on the left half with the same color tiles. The only limiter is if that row has already tiles a piece of that color previously completed.

Respuesta 2:
We played a game last night in which we 'house-ruled' that if you have a row started (but incomplete) on the left, then you could not start another row during that game turn. But, once that line is complete, you could then start another line of the same turn before the current game turn is over.

Respuesta 4:
it was because the question came up, and we didn't have the rules handy, so decided to play it that way. It went fine. The rule (I now know) as per the publisher is that you a) may have multiple rows of the same color in progress at the same time; b) but may only play to one row on a single round. Thus, if I have 2 incomplete rows of azul (blue) on my lines and take 2 or more blue tiles from a factory, I must play them on only one of those two lines. If there are excess blue tiles, I must play them to the floor (and may NOT put them on the other incomplete blue line).

Yes, it is a puzzle game. If you like puzzle games, I would suggest trying again with 2 and also 4 players. My first game I just played to see how it worked knowing there was more to it than just multiplayer solitaire.

The second game I saw the need to maximise what I required without allowing good collections of tiles that favoured the other players.

Like another person wrote recently, like a game of chess you are going to mess up the other’s moves knowing they will mess up yours. I find this fun because it’s back and forth. It’s not like when someone messes up your game completely in one move that you can’t recover from.

Hope this helps. If not, I guess it was never for you. Also, simple rules in simple abstracts lead to not a lot of depth but usually some great gameplay.

Have fun.

So after all the hype I bought this game and went through the rules and played a game. And. Um. What's the big deal? There's nothing to this game. It's as dull as anything. What am I missing?

I never rate things, or haven't done for years.

I was just wondering what I am missing. I guess it's just not a game for me. You're just selecting tiles, putting them on your thing and moving them over to score. It's a puzzle but not a very exciting one.
That's fair (although for me comments are more useful than ratings). However, an empty history does make it difficult/impossible to have a quick thumbnail sense of you as a gamer, your likes and dislikes, or to be able to carry on a conversation (edit: or an informed conversation) about why any given game would be a hit or miss for you.

Like I said, though, Azul will be good trade fodder for you. Probably. Hard to tell for sure!

I don't understand the hype about India Pale Ales. How could anybody possibly like them? WAAAYYYY too bitter.....especially the current trendy small brewers take on them.
I like my beers to actually taste good, not leave me feeling like I'm chewing a mouthful of hops.



Tema 585: Why I won’t be purchasing Azul
Pregunta:
Exclusive distribution. That’s why.

I believe in supporting my FLGS and they do a great job of keeping prices competitive. It’s a great store and they have a huge selection of games.

Azul is a game that on the surface is one I might like, and would pick up on impulse. But alas, on a recent visit, they will not be getting a copy since they don’t use GTS.

I feel it’s important to let the publisher know they missed a sale, pushing away and isolating a great reseller, and maybe the 15$ they would make off me isn’t important, but I want to highlight that exclusive deals are not in our best interest as consumers.

Plan B is created after Asmodee buys F2Z but not all of it, the remaining part becomes Plan B.

I'm not following your point with the publishers costs. Also keep in mind I'm not defending the OPs point of not buying the game but I think a small business owner working with one distributor isn't terribly surprising.

This complaint seems very arrogant and presumptuous. You should speak to your FLGS about dealing with multiple distributors, don't take it out on the publisher. This seems like misplaced anger to me.
OP is likely speaking about my store, and I appreciate the sentiment. I also don't think he's taking it out on the publisher but simply letting them know that since their game isn't readily available where he likes to shop that he's likely to pass on it. You go to the grocery store to buy a specific brand of ketchup, but they don't carry it - do you run all over town to find it or order it on line? or do you just grab the one you think is the next best equivalent?

And for the record, speaking of presumptuous, he doesn't have to speak to us about using multiple distributors as we already use 4 major distributors and deal directly with numerous publishers for the 3000+ games we stock.

We used to deal with GTS 2 years ago, until they completely screwed us over on a magic release where they decided to allocate all of their release product to those stores who purchased prerelease product from them, leaving none for those of us who hadn't done our prerelease orders with them. This would have been acceptable had they actually told us we weren't allocated any product ahead of time, but I didn't find out until I called them to ask where my order was after release weekend, at which point I had already missed my window to acquire enough product to meet my customers' demands. I vowed at that point to never use them again.

This is not an issue about retailers not wanting to use multiple distributors (although surely there are those stores who only use single distributors). Alliance started these shenanigans years ago with exclusive distribution and then every other distributor since has started the same. This plays havoc on retailers because now we have to manage numerous distributors and constantly figure out which distributors will have which games and which ones won't. We need to hit minimum order sizes for free shipping and now we can't just toss a copy of this or that to round out an order and we have to build 2 $300-$400 orders rather than just 1. And as much as I want to be able to carry every game out there, I'm not opening an account with a distributor only to acquire 1 or 2 titles. And it really sucks that I can't provide my customers with every title that they want.

I'm fully aware publishers and designers have many hurdles themselves - I've talked with quite a few through the many Unpub events we hold at the store and that I've attended elsewhere. Everything from distributors not wanting to give them the time of day because they're untested or too small to strong arming them with unfavorable terms. A publisher can get away without using distribution, but it's a truly uphill battle to sell their products that way. I'm one person and can't deal with 100 different publishers, and frequently I don't want full cases of products. Enter distribution - retailers can get smaller quantities and deal with fewer big accounts instead of dozens of individuals.

What I can't understand is what the publisher gets out of an exclusive deal that limits their exposure. Why would you go exclusive rather than maximize the number of outlets you can get your game distributed through? From my point of view the only benefit is for the distributor who knows they don't have to compete on price and anyone who wants the game has to get it from them, so it's guaranteed revenue.

In the case of Asmodee & Alliance, Asmodee got a fully dedicated sales staff inside Alliance who deal solely with Asmodee products. I get a 2nd sales rep who is knowledgeable in Asmodee products and it's their job to educate about, push and update on those products. Of course that sounds like a sweet deal for Asmodee and of course Alliance gets to enjoy the exclusive revenue from Asmodee's huge portfolio. But what does a small publisher get out of exclusivity other than having to trust a single distributor to push their 1 or 2 products in a sea of thousands of other products they distribute?

As Chris suggested, I can't see how exclusive distribution can be good for the industry. Most game stores already limit the titles they carry due to space or inventory constraints. Why limit even further who can obtain your game? The more consumers and retailers have to jump through hoops to obtain something, the less likely they're going to. There are thousands of games available out there - why work harder to get a particular game when there are 15 others on your short list readily available?

As a retailer, I'm already disappointed I can't obtain Century Spice Road and Azul as well as Pretzel Games products. I would have loved to provide them to my customers but it's not worth the hassle to obtain them at this point and I'm not compromising my principles to deal with a distributor who clearly felt my business wasn't as worthy as some of their other accounts.

But even though I'm not a particularly great customer, I have to say that Karl always, and I mean ALWAYS, has my particular brand of ketchup in stock. I never have to go anywhere else for any of my condiments.

By that I mean, his customer service is second to none. Sure, his inventory is extensive and impressive, and my eyes light up more than a kid in a candy store's do when I go in there, but that's only part of the reason I take all my game buying business there.

Sure, he doesn't stock every single game on the market, but if you can't find something worth playing in The Games Keep, you're probably not even in The Games Keep - you've probably walked into Gramm's Kitchen by mistake.

With all due respect to your perspective as a retailer, I don't think comparing a game to a consumer packaged good is really a good analogy. Ketchup (or toothpaste or name-your-product here) is a low-priced, fast-moving product and is largely fungible. If my local grocery store doesn't carry Portland Ketchup Company (which is, yes, a real ketchup brand), but I need ketchup, I'm going to be reasonably satisfied with an alternative brand, even if it's Heinz. And I probably won't buy another bottle until I run out. I certainly wouldn't bother to track down something as trivial as ketchup online.

Board games have some degree of fungibility, to be sure. There's a lot of discussion about games that substitute for one another (Do I really need Voyages of Marco Polo  and Lorenzo il Magnifico ?), but it's not anywhere near the degree of CPGs.

Take Azul and Splendor. Both games ostensibly fill a similar niche: 2-4p 30-minute abstract fillers with low rules overhead.

However, if Azul is a game I think is going to really resonate with my gaming group, then picking up a copy of Splendor isn't necessarily going to satisfy on the same level. I may enjoy Splendor (indeed, I do), but the two games are entirely different gaming experiences.

Some people like to do a lot of arm waving about the principles of supporting their local FLGS, but the truth is most consumers aren't particularly good at voting with their wallets (see this: https://www.marketwatch.com/story/starbucks-boycott-like-mos...). There are certainly a handful of people willing to stand on this kind of principle, but mostly people will just say, "Yeah, but I want to buy Azul, so I'll find it elsewhere."

The somewhat brutal reality is the location where people buy games (be it online or an FLGS) is far more fungible than the product itself.

Thank you for providing your insight and perspective on the OPs complaint, and subsequent comments. You must operate a good LGS because you certainly have fans.

You are correct, supply chain forces do have affect how publishers, distributors, retailers, and customers all share in a symbiotic relationship.

I see a future path similar to other publishing industries such as comic books, music, and newspapers.

One used to be able to buy a newspaper at a retail storefront, newsstand, vending machine, or via home delivery.

The analogy follows big box retailer, hobby game store, and Amazon or OLGS.

None of those models are/were optimized to maximize profits for anyone in the supply chain. Certainly some models and practices were better than others but usually one entity benefits $$ to the detriment of another. These pockets of inefficiency make problems that ripple and cause everyone to gripe.

The game hobby is on a phenomenal growth curve an no one cares about the weakness inherent in the system.

I do have confidence in the power of market forces and believe a better way to get games from those who create games into the hands of those wanting the games is going to improve. Unfortunately, that vision doesn't include distributors or retailers serving in their current capacities. Vasel and I share similar perspectives.

You can argue semantics of how good/bad the analogy is if you want. The simple point I was trying to make is after running an FLGS for almost 13 years I've seen more than enough impulse substitutions for games. Sure, many people are set on a specific game and get it wherever they can because that's the one they want. Some will pay double MSRP to if it's out of print, many more will simply wait until it's back in print or more readily available or they'll just skip it altogether and move to their next choice.

OP was simply letting the publisher know that he was on the fence to purchase it and had it been in a store during his visit he probably would have. Since it's not readily available at his convenient haunts it'll likely get added to the end of a very long wish list, only to get buried under the dozens of hot new titles spewing forth almost weekly.

It's basic marketing theory in an impulsive luxury industry. If your product isn't on hand at the time a consumer wants it, they're more likely to purchase something else. I get 40-80 new titles each month. The shear volume of choices competing for consumers' money, play time and storage space is on the verge of ridiculous at this point. Limiting your sales channels just isn't a wise decision in most cases. Publishers should REALLY think long and hard about what their benefits are in exclusive distribution deals and are they worth it.

I agree there will be some major changes down the road because this industry can't sustain the volume of games and publishers at the current rates. The industry will likely become more efficient, however it'll never achieve maximum efficiency or even close. It will always be inefficient for a variety of reasons.

I will however disagree that distribution and/or the FLGS are going to disappear. If I had a dime for every time I've heard those predictions the last 10 years I'd be able to buy Asmodee outright. Amazon, Kickstarter, and big box were all supposed to have put the nail in the coffins of distribution and the FLGS. They're both in general stronger than ever. FLGS's come and go, but for each that goes, 2 more open up.

Your major changes will be in the publishing, design and manufacturing facets of the industry. They'll consolidate, split, disappear, and new ones given birth to. Big box can have their token exclusives because their business model can't support the diversity and individualism that drives the industry and never will. But that's a discussion for another time....

Tema 586: Scoring clarification
Pregunta:
I place a tile that creates a 3x1 row. Does it score 3 or 4 points?

At first glance, the rules suggest only 3 (a tile doesn’t score itself twice if it is the only tile counting vertically or horizontally). Even the examples *seem* to support this.

However, the rules also say “if there are 1or more tiles... count all linked tiles, including the one just placed”, which would suggest 4 points. In fact, the only time the rules specifically state a tile is only counted once is when it has no adjacent tiles in any direction.

Thoughts?

Thanks everyone for your replies. The comment about shipping a parcel from Canada to Continental US taking about two weeks was especially enlightening!

I'll probably give it a few more weeks before I raise the matter further.

I'm however a little disappointed it'll take that long, especially since Australian retailers will receive their stock of Azul within the next week or so. I will probably just preorder from my FLGS rather than Plan B Games in the future given the apparent inefficiency of Canada Post.

Note: the above isn't a knock on Plan B Games, as I know you are not in control over Canada Post's shipping schedule. I love Century Spice Road, and I know Azul will be amazing just based on JonGetsGames' play through video. I'm just a little annoyed at myself for not doing the required research into shipping timeframe prior to preordering. However, it'll be greatly appreciated if Plan B Games will put up a disclaimer that overseas pre-orders might not arrive before retailers get their stock for future new releases, simply due to the vagaries of international shipping.

I’m based in Australia. My copy of Azul was shipped 3 weeks ago, but I have yet to receive it. I never had anything shipped from Canada before, so I’m not sure if I should start panicking just yet?
I can tell you that Canada Post doesn't provide tracking numbers for international shipments. Further, Australia can take 8-12 weeks for delivery. It can be shorter, but it's the holiday season.

That is true. It took me two weeks to ship a box to Puerto Rico from the continental US.
Thanks everyone for your replies. The comment about shipping a parcel from Canada to Continental US taking about two weeks was especially enlightening!

I'll probably give it a few more weeks before I raise the matter further.

I'm however a little disappointed it'll take that long, especially since Australian retailers will receive their stock of Azul within the next week or so. I will probably just preorder from my FLGS rather than Plan B Games in the future given the apparent inefficiency of Canada Post.

Note: the above isn't a knock on Plan B Games, as I know you are not in control over Canada Post's shipping schedule. I love Century Spice Road, and I know Azul will be amazing just based on JonGetsGames' play through video. I'm just a little annoyed at myself for not doing the required research into shipping timeframe prior to preordering. However, it'll be greatly appreciated if Plan B Games will put up a disclaimer that overseas pre-orders might not arrive before retailers get their stock for future new releases, simply due to the vagaries of international shipping.
We are exploring options for faster and more transparent shipping. We want our fans to have their games ASAP.

An update:
It's been now more than 3 months since I received the shipping notice for Azul, but I have yet to receive my copy. I'd sent a few emails but have not gotten any response.

Any assistance will be greatly appreciated.

Further update:
It appears that they are very responsive on Facebook Messenger. They refunded my pre-order. Now going to buy Azul from my FLGS instead.



Tema 588: Silly Question?
Pregunta:
Hello.

Playing devil's advocate here:

Why would now not complete a row of five in five turns (putting the first player at advantage) by filling the top row after taking a single tile of a color different from the previous ones?

If placing those in sequential order, left to right (or vice versa) you could probably generate enough points to win every time, no?

I could totally (and likely, am) missing something here - please prove me wrong.

Respuesta 1:
I wonder if you are mistaken about the overall structure of the game.

A turn allows you to claim a number of tiles that then go into the "staging area". At the end of the round (which is only after all tiles have been drafted) any tiles from the far right column of the staging area which are in a completed row can be moved over to the tile wall and scored.

So, it would take five rounds to complete a row, not five turns.

Respuesta 2:
Because the winner is the player who scores the most points, not to one who's first to finish a horizontal line. And I think there are many ways to score more points even than someone who maximizes points while also aiming for a game that ends in five rounds. Most two player games I've played were over in five rounds, but they weren't won by the same opponent each and every time.

Respuesta 3:
Yeah, I think you need to reread the rules. Games frequently end in the minimum five *rounds* but you can place a lot more than five tiles in that time.

Respuesta 4:
I haven't played yet (haven't even read the rules...just watched a few videos), but the game flow is that you continue to take tiles until they have all been distributed before scoring each round. So while it may be a good strategy to try to rush the end of the game by filling the top row in just 5 rounds, it's what you do with the other tiles that will determine who wins the game.

If people see you rushing to end the game, I would assume they would do a similar thing....since the most points you can score by placing 5 tiles is 5-in-a-row.

Also, don't forget that if you want one red, you have to take what is available....if it's only a set of 3 red, the 2 excess tiles will fall the floor and give you negative points.

Edit: don't forget that in the time it takes you to fill one row, it's possible for another player to fill two rows (as you can place multiple tiles in the same turn).

Respuesta 5:
So, yes. You're right. IT's very possible to fill the top row in 5 turns. Most games I've played end in 5 or 6 turns. However, most points come from collecting all of one color, from finishing columns, and from making bigger and bigger crosses. In several games I've played, players who are able to end the game don't do it, precisely because they're behind in points.

How is this possible? Each ROUND you can only slide over one tile in each row. So the most tiles you can slide are 5 and only one in each row. So there is no way that by the time I fill up one row (five rounds), someone has filled up two rows. Plus, every time you slide over a tile, you cannot place another tile of the same color in that row, so you need a minimum of five rounds before you can do this, assuming you clear that line each round, which is obviously easier for the first line relative to the second, second relative to third, etc.

It's possible to fill up the top row in five ROUNDS, not turns. If you placed a single tile in the lone space up top on your player board on your first turn, on your next turn you would have to place tiles somewhere else (lines 2-5). So you cannot fill up the top row in five turns. You only slide over tiles once EVERY tile has been taken from the factories and the center of the table, not after each placement.

Yup I think turn/round confusion must be what's caused the OP's confusion. Scoring and moving tiles only happens at the end of a round, not at the end of a turn.

It would take five rounds to be able to end the game, and in that time you will have moved over many more than five tiles.

Since you can move one tile into each row each round, it's theoretically possible to fill all five rows in five rounds!

I'm not sure I understand your point. There's no reason why someone couldn't have filled two horizontal rows in five rounds.

It's fairly viable that each round you could fill the 1 tile and 2 tiles pattern rows, meaning that by five rounds you've completed two rows. I'm not sure it's at all the best strategy, but I don't see what's impossible about it.

Thank you to all for humoring my question and clarifying the rules and flow.



Tema 589: Horizontal in variant
Pregunta:
I know the rules specifically say you cannot repeat colours vertically. But why the enphasis in vertical? Can you, on the contrary, repeat horizontally or do the normal rules apply (cannot start a line where theres already that colour) ?

Thks

Respuesta 1:
I presume you're talking about the advanced variant (grey side).

All the rules of the basic game still apply so you can't start a pattern line in a colour that's already present in the wall for that line.

This means you will end up with a pattern that doesn't repeat horizontally or vertically.

Respuesta 2:
Thanks

We initially thought we were prohibited only vertically because of the emphasis on "vertical" in the rulebook. But then I started thinking it didnt make much sense.

It wouldnt hurt if the rulebook could remember that rule again in the advanced variant section.

Thks again!

Respuesta 3:
Yeah, I tripped over it the first time I read it too, before I realised that the horizontal repetition is already disallowed by the base rules.



Tema 590: First player placement
Pregunta:
I assume this is isn't the case, but it seems odd that the instructions specifically call out that the first player is the one to place tiles in factories. When you're placing tiles in factories do you get any choice about what tiles get placed where or is it intended that all tile placement in factories is random? We played basically where you just took a handful of tiles and placed them around the wheel, but was it intended that the first player gets some control over that due to the negative they got in the previous round?

Tiles are to be distributed randomly with absolutely no explicit control by any player.

Respuesta 2:
I've always understood that it was just a way of distributing the filling work - so rather than one person always doing it you take it in turns. I'm very sure it's done randomly - you select 4 tiles and place them in any empty factory (of course you can choose which factory they all go in, but that won't achieve anything).

C. Preparing the next round
If nobody has completed a horizontal line of 5 consecutive tiles
on her wall yet (see End of the game), prepare the next round.
The player with the starting player marker refills each of the
Factory displays with 4 tiles from the bag as in the setup.

Tema 591: Original Rules Myth
Pregunta:
At BGG Con, I heard from several sources that the original (old? Prototype?) rules state that you cannot be housing 2 rows in your building area (pattern line) of the same color/type. So, you could, for instance, not grab reds to put in one row AND later in the same round pull more reds to put in a different row. However, I cannot find any proof of these rules existing anywhere. Has anyone else encountered these possible rules? Maybe Mr. Kiesling could share some design insight...

Thanks!

Respuesta 1:
At BGG Con I was taught that you could not place the same pattern in another row if you already had one in a prior row that was filled.

After the game I read the rules and in a picture example they show two rows with the same pattern and I could not find in the rules that you can't put the same pattern in more than one row.

It could be that the rules were changed prior to the final production.

Respuesta 2:
Yeah, I have seen people make this mistake and I'm not sure where it came from. I wasn't privy to the original rules so my understanding all comes from the rule set we have now which spells it out pretty clear.

Respuesta 3:
When teaching, I make sure that new players know that this IS allowed.

I've run into a few people who just assume the restriction is there when really it is not.

Respuesta 4:
It is my understanding that when you take tiles, you must place all you take on a single line, with any excess tiles over the line limit going to the floor. Thus, if I have started 'red' on line 3, and have 1 red tile already on that line, and later take 2 red tiles from another factory, I could either, place both tiles on the 3 line (to finish it out), or both on another empty (or red) line - but I could not divide the two reds I just took from the factory, placing them on different lines on the same turn.


Where am I wrong/or right)?

Respuesta 5:
Out of curiosity (for science!), I tried these alleged original rules and found that while the game is still fantastic Azul, the limitations make it harder and, unfortunately, less rewarding due to a homogenization of the end game. For instance, I cannot choose to rush black tiles to force the end game in any particular round as a strategical decision, making meaningful and varied strategies less prevalent or even possible. It's more difficult and constricting without adding tension or any element of fun compared to what is already a deep, elegant, and challenging ruleset included in this "new" (or only) version of the game.

I agree with Chris - I make sure to point out the rules, citing the pictures in the rulebook which immediately clarify the row flexibility in the pattern line.

Hopefully, someone can come forward and explain where this myth originated. Maybe they were Kiesling's original rules before being edited or modified by Plan B/Kiesling himself.

Respuesta 6:
Wow this is good to read - every review I have seen/heard so far has used the "wrong" rules. Now the game makes a bit more sense :)

Respuesta 7:
Frank,

As I understand it, the tiles you pick up in a single turn must go to one pattern line and only one pattern line - there is no splitting up the tiles you collect on any one given turn. However, where you place those tiles is up to you, assuming you follow the rules on tile placement (e.g. if a pattern line already has a colored tile in it, then subsequent tiles must match).

Hope this help! My original question has to do with a rules myth or variant at BGG Con where you could only represent a tile type in only one row of the pattern line area (which is not true when referencing the current printed rules).

Rhado plays this correctly.

You do not have to complete a row of a color before starting another row of the same color.

The three restrictions are
1. That all the tiles from a single pick up must go into the same pattern line.
2. That you may not place tiles of a specific color into a pattern line if the wall line already contains that color.

Tema 592: I found the game lacking in oomph. What am I missing?
Pregunta:
I found Azul to be very procedural with 4 players, and was surprised there was almost no hate drafting. And that wasn't due to not looking for opportunities to do so either. Almost every time luck of the draw meant grabbing the best option for ourselves, to maximize our own score, rather than attempting to block or force someone to take too many tiles in the color they wanted? Maybe it's due to us all working in engineering/comp. sci. but we all just started in a corner and worked outward, maximizing row and column counts. It seemed very obvious how to play to maximize your score. We didn't have any issues whatsoever at finding what we wanted to place on the board, even when someone took a tile we really wanted. There were always other options that were almost as good. There was definitely no oomph in this game for me.

I was surprised because I really enjoy Sagrada at 4 players, and I thought this would play the same way. I'm not sure why it feels so different. With Sagrada you're starting from one corner and working out, as we all did here (to maximize points). Sagrada has similar tile placement (color/pattern) limitations, but maybe better tension due to the rarity of numbers (which correspond to Azil's patterns) due to rolling the dice? In Azul the patterns stay the same. There's no placing a "4" red vs a "6" red tile, for example.

So Azul fans, what am I missing? Does this work better at lower player counts? Is playing with four simply too random?

Respuesta 1:
It is okay to not like a popular game! it really is!

Perhaps like you have suggested different player counts might help but for now know it is okay to not like it.

Respuesta 2:
This is kind of funny -- I played my first game of Azul earlier today and wondered something similar but for totally different reasons. Our 2p game was nothing but hate drafting, and it was really great. With only five factory tiles, it was nearly guaranteed that one color was scarce, and a lot of the hate drafting started by really taking advantage of that scarcity. It sounds like the additional factory tiles at 4p either remove that scarcity, or reduce it too much. Just a guess; having played this game exactly once, I'll never claim to see it with perfect clarity.

The engineering/computer science thing may not have much to do with it; if anything, that demographic would be better at focusing on the deltas rather than the raw scores. Our game couldn't have functioned if we were maximizing our This-Turn points, as there were definitely turns where my 5 point placement meant a 6-point placement on her next move. I really enjoyed this feature and suspected that at 4p it would have bogged the game down too much. Computing three deltas, especially at the endgame, would be awful to sit through. Sounds like that didn't happen in your game, so maybe my feeling was wrong and the sheer number of tiles to choose from sort of neuters the game a bit.

I'm somewhat terrible at making gaming predictions, but I suspect that as more and more players play this over the next couple weeks, it'll start to shake out that it's best at 2p. The higher the player count, maybe the easier it is to play it as a "put your head down and focus on your own player board" kind of game. All I know is that I'm looking forward to playing this again at 2p. I thought it had a lot of oomph, for sure.

EDIT: I just did a Geekbuddy analysis and one of my Geekbuddies, who I trust on matters like this since we both enjoy incentivization games for similar reasons, has this to say about the 4p game of Azul:

Quote:
UPDATE: Played with 4, the scoring seems to be much higher. It's harder to fork other players, so you don't get caught in bad situations as often. There are also more tiles to look at in a turn, so you can usually find what you need in the first couple of passes through the new tiles.

I don't think I'm interested in playing it with 4 again, as the forking is what interests me about the game. But 3 could be very good, giving the right combination of forking, more information than with 2, and no zero-sum outcomes.
It could be that this game can function as a leisurely, point-grabbing Euro at all player counts, but functions best as a more aggressive game at 2p and loses aggression (and control?) the higher the count. I'll likely never play it 4p, so I may have to learn this from afar.

Respuesta 3:
I played twice last night, both at four players, and felt similar to the OP. It's really hard to plan ahead in the four player game because you don't know if the other players are going to take from a factory or from the center, so on your turn there may be only two tiles of a certain color in the center but by the time it comes back to you there could be seven and there is no way to plan ahead for that. It definitely seems like the four player game is more "do what's best for me" and less "do what's worst for the other players".

Respuesta 4:
I have played it at all player counts. Love it at all three. With two, it is easier to see the 'hate' drafting - but it is there at all counts. In all three player counts I have found myself watching what others are doing. I think one of the keys to effective playing is keeping up with the plans of others as well as your own - and effectively planning for two to three other situations. "If the blue is taken, then I should go for the yellow/red, or else the black, because..."

I love the various possibilities and eventualities and how to prepare for them. I haven't really seen that much difference in player counts - all were exciting and brain challenging.

Respuesta 5:
Don't let 1-2 plays determine your opinion. I've now played a dozen times and things continue to evolve for me tactically. You begin to realize the ebbs and flows of tile counts, possibilities for getting what you need, and if you play with the same people, tendencies. I'm afraid that we spend too little time with many of the titles we own to see past the initial impressions.

Respuesta 6:
I'd make sure that the unused tiles at the end of the round are not going back into the bag, but put aside until the bag runs out of tiles and then is refilled. This will control the flow of the different colors and allow for hoarding them more. If two people complete row 4 and 5 blue, for example, then half of the blue tiles are gone until all the tiles are used up.

Respuesta 7:
I only have 7 plays so far (6 at 4-player, 1 at 3-player), which isn't enough to make a judgement on, but to date my experience is that whether or not there is 'hate-drafting' (or as I prefer to call it, 'dicking over' other players has nothing whatever to do with the player count and a lot to do with the people who are playing it.

While I got dicked over considerably in a couple of games with a particular player at the table (playing directly before me), in other games there was only a very small amount of it, and I was probably as bad/good as anyone else. My attitude was to pick the best thing for me, but where I had options and no obvious 'must-have', then I'd see what I could do to make it less helpful for other players and choose accordingly - as long as it was still reasonable for me.

In the 3-player game no-one dicked over anyone at all (not intentionally, anyway) and I scored 132 pts, which is the highest score I've come across yet.

Was also interested in your comment about starting in a corner. Surely it's best to start in the middle? Then you have better options (i.e. play the colour on either side of the first tile, instead of being restricted to the colour on one side).

This was my thought as well. I always tried to start as close to the center as possible. Sagrada forces you to start in a corner. This game does not.

Respuesta 9:
I've played three times with 4p and once with 3p. I think that the fewer players, the more intentional the screwage will become, but it's definitely still there in 4p if the players choose to go that way. We had several occasions where a colour no one wanted piled up in the middle and someone ended up being forced to take 5+, flooding their floor spaces.

I think I will end up liking 3p best - more intentional screwage than 4p but not completely zero-sum.

I played last night (came last again) and, although there were numerous howls of "you took the only die I could place", there was only really one move in the whole game where someone intentionally dicked anyone over (took a yellow 5 which both I and another player needed desperately, when he could've taken a couple of other dice).

Ah, I think you hit the nail on the head! I definitely came away with the impression that Sagrada was much more of a puzzle, which I prefer. I expected Azul to be more of the same, but it's not. It's a different beast, and that's fine, it's just not for me.



Tema 593: When is Azul at Canadian Online Retailers

Expected in retailers in the first week of December.

Tema 594: Can i huse tiles this Way?
Pregunta:
Lets say i’ve Got 3 blue tiles laying in my tile pattern (5 tiles row) in my next turn i draw another 3 blue tiles do i Then have to finish up my blue row before i Can lay the remaining tiles in other Rows? Or Can i freely start a new row if i have a unfinished row in the same color?

Respuesta 1:
If I have read the rules right, you take the 3 blues and put two in your row to finish the 5 and the last 1 blue goes down to your floor tile row at the bottom. The rows aren't reconciled until the end of the round, I believe, so there would be no place else for that 1 blue tile to go.

You can start as many (well, 5) rows of the same colour. What you can't do is place tiles in different rows in one turn.

Respuesta 3:
To sum it up, you have two options:

1) Place 2 of them in your 5 row, and place the other one in your floor line.

2) Place them in a new row (possibly placing any extras in your floor line if you choose to put them in your 1 or 2 row).

Page 3:

Once all spaces of a pattern line are filled, that line is considered complete. If you have picked up more tiles than you can place in your chosen pattern line, you must place the excess tiles in the floor line (see Floor line).

Three phases to a turn.

Phase A. Pick up and place tiles on your board. Those tiles stay on the line through the entire phase. Thus, if you fill a line, it stays filled until phase B. This means you can't fill a line, take it off, and then place the remaining tiles on that line.

Technically, you can't do that anyway since the rules also state on page 4:

In all later rounds, you must also comply with the following
rule: You are not allowed to place tiles of a certain color in
a pattern line whose corresponding line of your wall already
holds a tile of that color.

So, if you filled 5 red on the bottom line, you could not place another red on the 5 line at any point in the game.

Phase B. Tile the board. This is where the tiles on your lines on the left come off and one tile is transferred to the scoring panel on the right.

Phase C. Preparation for the next round. Check for win conditions and refill the factories.

It's in the rules.

Yes, but I still sense some possible confusion. In a further attempt at clarity:

2. You CANNOT place tiles in a pattern line if that kind of tile is already in the matching wall line (right side of the board).

Chris emphasized the rule for the second case when the question was about the first case (as far as I can tell).

Chris emphasized the rule for the second case when the question was about the first case (as far as I can tell).
In the OP's question, we was wanting to pull three red. The OP was basically asking if he could place 2 of those three to complete the 5 red and then either complete the line and remove the tiles to then place the remaining red on the 5 line, or if he could place that remaining tile on another line instead.

It was pointed out that he could place those three red on a different line instead of using them to complete the 5-line. And yes, that is totally acceptable as long as the other line hasn't completed a tile of that color earlier in the game (as referred to by the rule on page 4).

My quotes were pointing out that in the rules, it stated that you can do it as long as you don't do *this* and that you must place all tiles collected on one line, which if you have any left over after completing the grouping, it must go on the floor line.

I apologize for not being clearer but , no, I was not addressing "matching wall tiles" already placed on the wall. I was addressing the leftside collecting tiles row not the wall row itself.
I believe that there is not any good term for the left side spaces is at the root of this confusion. I put forward the term "carrier" line. ( "thematicly" itis harder to carry tiles to the top of the wall than to the bottom)

The rulebook calls that area the 'pattern lines'. When I'm explaining the game I call it the 'preparation area'.



Tema 595: EDIT: NO NEED FOR Alternative Scoring Track(s)...
Pregunta:
A number of people have complained about the scoring tracks for each player and how it is relatively easy for the player mat to get knocked losing the score’s place.

I am still going to use the track but wondered what those people have used as an alternative?

I had a look at my own collection and I think Carcassonne uses 0-50 tracks so with two you could get to 100 and have different coloured cubes or different meeples for each player.

But I have no independent/separate scoring track with 100 spaces.



EDIT: played yesterday at Pasteboard and Plastic with no probs on ticket tables in a scout hut and had no probs.

Unless playing at Essen, I think it’s perfectly fine.

Respuesta 1:
has life trackers that are dials that go up to 100.

Respuesta 2:
I'm actually contemplating finding someone to drill holes in each square of the scoretracks in order to turn them into pegboards. I have some pegs from an old Battleship game that seem to be of the right size and color.

Respuesta 3:
A nice plastic overlay would be pretty great for Azul. It would help with the scoring track and also keep the tiles super tidy looking.

Respuesta 4:
Also, cribbage boards are good for keeping score for lots of games. Bonus: you can use it to play Cribbage.

Respuesta 5:
Of course. I hadn't thought of that. Good call on Cribbage.

Respuesta 6:
Just ordered the game and was thinking of using the score track
from Castles of Mad King Ludwig, really dont like the idea of separate score tracks for each player, like to see everyone on the same track
especially if I'm winning
Of course you could put out any game board with a scoring track on it
put the discs with the cubes on the game board and just have the player
boards in front of you

Respuesta 7:
It's fairly easy to make a counting mistake on the score track and a cube can get accidentally bumped for all manner of reasons. When either happens, there are no safety nets to ensure a correct score.

So why bother with cubes and score tracks? Just get somebody to keep score on a piece of paper (Scrabble style).

Respuesta 8:
I use the Scythe metal coins.
Maybe not the most fitting coins, but actually makes sense that you are winning money while doing your job. Fits the theme.



Tema 596: Can't pick up tiles?
Pregunta:
Love this game but we ran into a rules question we couldn't find an answer to in the rule book. What should you do when a player can't pick up any tiles? That is, the only colors left to pick up are ones they cannot place in their pattern lines because either the pattern line already has that color on the pattern wall or the pattern line is all filled up. So do you skip their turn, have them pick tiles and place them in the box, or pick tiles and they go to the floor line?

You pick tiles and place them on your floor line (obviously worth choosing the colour with the least number of tiles to limit the damage).

Edit: This is covered in the Floor Line rules "Any tiles you have picked that you cannot or do not want to place according to the rules, you must place in your floor line..."

Respuesta 2:
and in the rare case that your floor is full, then the extra tiles just go back in the box, you get no penalties for these.

Tema 597: Variant Play With Joker Tiles
Pregunta:
Which rules take precedence in a variant play game using joker tiles? Joker tile rules say any vertical or horizontal line may include several joker tiles. Variant play rules say no color may appear more than once in a vertical line. Do joker tiles count as a color in variant play?

Respuesta 1:
Both rules remain in effect as they do not contradict each other.
Quote:
If a joker tile occupies a space on the wall of a certain color, you MAY NOT place tiles of that color in the corresponding pattern line any more.

Any vertical or horizontal line on the wall may include several joker tiles.
Basically joker tiles are joker tiles and are not placed as other tiles.

For placement blocking purposes they will assume the color that is on the wall beneath them.

Since the variant board has no colored spaces, the joker tiles will never block the placement of other tiles (joker or otherwise) on the variant board.

Tema 599: When do you go to wall-tiling
Pregunta:
Tiles are drafted until all factories and the center area are empty. In other words, the wall-tiling phase does not occur until every single tile placed during the preparation phase has been taken.

Respuesta 1:
You have to take all tiles of an individual color either from a single factory or from the center on your turn. There is no passing.

Respuesta 2:
Specifically, the rules say:

Quote:
This phase ends when the center of the table AND all Factory displays contain no more tiles. Then, continue with the Wall-tiling phase.
This seems pretty clear to me. It does not explicitly say "players keep taking turns" but it's implied by what is stated; no set of rules can explicitly state every detail.

Tema 601: No Joker tiles arrived!

Hello to all,

What makes me mad is that I purchased online exclusively for the tiles I have not received, paying customs (I live in Italy) on top of interanational shipping.

2) the original package I receive, containing just the game, came with a bill of landing that included the Joker tiles which were not present in the box! nothing had me thinking the tiles would have been shipped separately as some of you received them together with the game!

anyway I got the game and the tiles, so I'm happy of the final outcome.

Who starts the next round if no one takes the staring player marker? Same as before?
So, each factory disk began the round with 4 matching tiles? Seems like a near 0% chance of this happening.

Respuesta 2:
This would be impossible! Since ALL the tiles have to be taken from the table, and since every time someone takes a tile/tiles from a factory, the remaining tiles move to the center, players are forced to have to draw tiles from the center. And the first one to do so will have to take the Starting Player Tile.

Respuesta 3:
Aha. Idiot hour at our house, we totally missed the rule that you keep going until all tiles have gone. *embarrassed face*

Respuesta 4:
If no one took the 1st player marker, round 2 would never begin.

Oh man we were playing this wrong. So, we seeded factories with four tiles each, first player put first player marker in middle and made a choice, then each player made a choice, THEN we thought a new round began and we reseeded the factories to four tiles each. And of course the middle pile got bigger and bigger and we ran out of tiles very quickly.

Respuesta 6:
Although it could (extremely rarely) happen, that you pull 4 identical tiles for each factory disc. In this case, nobody would have to take the start player tile.
How would you rule this? You could simply say, all tiles and the start player marker have to be taken to end a round. Then players could invest a victory point in becoming start player or the player after the one who got the last tiles would be forced to take the marker.

I would simply handle the starting player "marker" as if it were a starting player "tile", meaning it has to be taken at some point even if each factory is seeded with four identical tiles.

Btw. that the starting player marker is cardboard instead of a tile is one of the few things that bug me about Azul.
A well, time to buy some fimo and make my own, probably in a hexagon shape to avoid mixing it up with the normal tiles, until Plan B Games brings out a Starting Player Tile Promo or an Azul Deluxe Edition.

This circumstance is so unlikely that it is not worth it to be included in the official rules. However, in this case, the starting player of the previous round simply remains the starting player. She doesn't take the starting player marker and thus does not gain any negative points for it. As she will always be the last one to take the last 4 tiles in such a scenario (and the only one to have acquired 3 x 4 tiles while the others only acquired 2 x 4 tiles), she will probably have quite a few negative points anyway.

Btw. that the starting player marker is cardboard instead of a tile is one of the few things that bug me about Azul.
A well, time to buy some fimo and make my own, probably in a hexagon shape to avoid mixing it up with the normal tiles, until Plan B Games brings out a Starting Player Tile Promo or an Azul Deluxe Edition.
The starting player tile in my copy of Azul is just a tile, made of the same material as the other tiles

Although it could (extremely rarely) happen, that you pull 4 identical tiles for each factory disc. In this case, nobody would have to take the start player tile.
How would you rule this? You could simply say, all tiles and the start player marker have to be taken to end a round. Then players could invest a victory point in becoming start player or the player after the one who got the last tiles would be forced to take the marker.

Yeah, surprising what can change in 5 years (or 5 months in this case).

The "first edition" of Azul included a cardboard first player token


They changed that in early 2018 to a resin tile (see  ) and offered a free replacement for owners of the first edition.


Another change that was made later was that the 4 scoring cubes - original made out of wood - were changed to resin due to covid concerns.

Azul

Designed by Michael Kiesling

Art by Philippe Guérin & Chris Quilliams

Published by Plan B Games

Azulejo is a form of Spanish and Portuguese painted ceramic tilework. They can be found inside Churches, Palaces, Schools and just about anywhere nowadays. They were originally brought to Portugal in the 15th Century by King Manuel after he visited Seville. He returned and decorated the Sintra National Palace with Azulejo tiles.

Azul, from Plan B Games, tile drafting, tile placement game in which you are competing against the other players to get your tiles placed in the Royal Palace of Evora, in the most pleasing way that will score you the most points.


Factory and 4 tiles

Setup for Azul is super simple. you figure out how many of you are playing and you put the correct number of coaster like Factories out on the table. Then, make sure all of your tiles are in the beautiful drawbag and you draw and place four tiles on each Factory. Everyone gets a player board and sits it in front of them and a small cube for your score marker that goes on the 0 at the start of your scoring track on your player board. Place the 1st player marker in the middle of all of the Factories and you are now ready to do some tiling.


Two tiles in a Pattern Row

On your turn you will do two things. You will take all of one color from one of the Factories on the table and the rest of the tiles that remain on that Factory will go to the middle of the table between all of the other Factories. You then will take your tiles that you drafted and you will pick a row on the left hand side of your board and you will place them there, filling up the blank spaces on the appropriate row. Note, you can only place tiles that you have taken on one row. If you have more tiles of a color than spaces on a row, those extra tiles will go to the Floor Line on the bottom of your board and will score you negative points at the end of the round. Sooner or later, someone is going to want some tiles that are in the center, or that first player marker, when they decide that, they just simply take all the tiles of the same color as before. If you are the first person to take from the center of the table, you will also take the First Player marker and it will go straight to your Floor Line. Play goes this way until all of the tiles are taken by the players, you will then proceed to the Wall Tiling phase.


Let's move some Tiles over to the wall

Wall Tiling is all about moving your completed rows of tiles over to the wall and scoring them. You do this from top to bottom. Move the rightmost tile of any completed row to the space of the same color in the corresponding row of your wall, each time you do this, you will score points immediately. After that you will remove any tiles from the blank pattern rows that now have no tile in the rightmost space and place them in the box or off to the side somewhere. If your Pattern Rows were not complete, they stay on the row.


Wall in progress of being tiled

Each tile that you move over to your wall is placed on the space matching it's color on that row and as said before, you will immediately score it. Scoring may be the trickiest part of this game, and it's not all that tricky, just takes a bit to get used to. A tile place on it's own on the Wall with nothing adjacent to it, will score one point. If that tile that was placed has another tile orthogonally adjacent to it, check to see if there are more tiles linked to the newly placed tile, if so, count all these linked tiles, including the one you just placed and gain that many points. You do this both horizontally AND vertically, each time counting the tile that was placed. After you have moved your tiles over and scored them, subtract the appropriate points from the Floor Line and remove those tiles from your Floor Line and place them off to the side and put the first player marker back in the middle of the board.

There are bonus points to score in Azul, I mean, what kind of game would it be without some completion goals, right? If you finish a column in your Tile Wall, you get a bonus of 7 points. If you manage to gather 5 of the same color/design, you get a 10 point bonus at the end of the game. And when you complete a full row in your Tile Wall, you get a bonus of 2 points.


Not quite end game, two Rows need one more tile to end the game

A game of Azul will end when someone fully completes a Wall Tile Row on their player board, meaning they have managed to place 5 tiles in a row. If no one has done that after scoring, load up the Factory Tiles as you did before and play will start with the player who took the First Player marker the previous round.

Azul was kind of an after thought for me during this busy Essen Spiel season. It was a game that always had looked intriguing to me, but it never pushed itself to the front of my "must have" list. It seemed to be a certainly beautiful game, but what was going to set it apart from the myriad of others that came at the same time? It didn't make my Top 5 Titles from Essen Spiel 2017 that I was excited about, it did get a mention though to be honest. But since Essen Spiel has ended and I have had a chance to play a handful of titles that released then, Azul has easily been the pack leader with a half dozen plays across all player counts since it's arrival here.

The drafting of tiles is interesting and there are decisions to be made that can affect how future turns play out because all of the other unselected tiles will accumulate in the middle for anyone to pick up when they think that it's worth taking that First Player marker and thusly the first negative points. Going first can really be a pretty big advantage in later rounds as you search for specific tiles to complete a Pattern Row.

There will be inevitable comparisons to *Sagrada* and I think that's completely fair. So far though, I think I prefer the openness of Azul. There are no secret scoring goals, you are just trying to tile the wall in front of you and get the best score possible while doing so. The bonus points are huge and completing columns in your Tile Wall is hugely important, those 7 points can loom pretty large in the scoring.

Since there are negative points to be gained in this game, it does benefit you to watch your opponents and carefully plan. You don't want to be the one ending up having to pick up that bunch of 6 tiles that will end up on you Tile Floor, you definitely want to save that for your opponents if possible. In a two player game this is a lot more obvious, and sometimes can feel a lot more vindictive or confrontational, but that's just the nature of the beast with most two player games. You have no one else to curse when you get stuck with something, just the person across the table from you. This gets hidden a bit in higher player counts as those tiles could be picked up or moved by any of the other players.

Of note in a two player game, Azul does end up giving perfect information towards the end if you can see all the discarded tiles and what is on yours and your opponent's player boards. Rarely is a game going to go more than 5 rounds, in fact I can't recall that we have had any go more than 5. I think that adding in the Joker Tiles(which I haven't talked about) and maybe playing the other side of the board will help in two player games. The Joker Tiles simply act like wild tiles and replace two of each color tile at the start of the game. The joker tiles are drafted just like the regular tiles, but when placed on the Tile Wall, it depends on what else is with them to decide on where they go. If a Pattern Line is full of Joker Tiles you can choose which tile to cover in the Tile Wall. If a Pattern Line has another color tile in it, the Joker Tile will fill that spot in the Tile Wall. The other side of the player board allows the players to choose their own pattern to follow in the Tile Wall. You still can only have one tile of each color/pattern in each row or column, but you don't have to follow the predetermined layout that is on the other side of the board. These changes probably will help the two player game from being a bit deterministic towards the end.

Plan B officially has only two games under their belt at the moment, Azul & Century: Spice Road, but this is not their first rodeo as you can tell. They know what they are doing in finding games that will appeal to a massive swath of players. These first two games could be staples in the Gateway Games category in the years to come with their ease of teaching, while still yielding very satisfying and very strategic play. The components are superb in Azul, which is another staple that Gateway Games need at this juncture in the hobby. No one wants to break out ugly games for their non-gamer friends, you want to break out something that is beautiful on the table, and Azul has that covered with the fun chunky tiles and the beautiful presentations as you tile the Palace of Evora. With the Holidays coming up here in the United States and our family visiting family nearly every weekend from here till Mid-January, Azul is going to be a staple in my game bag that I carry around with me to every family gathering.

Also, just because some of the tiles may remind you of Starbursts doesn't mean that you should try to eat them. I'd say 10 out of 10 Dentists will agree on that.


Also of note, that one token, that is your First Player Marker, do not throw it away, you will be sad.



There is even a spot for it in the insert. Seriously, Plan B has thought of it all here.

Very thorough review. Thanks for writing it! For me, this game would get old quickly, and for the price point, I don't see why there should be any plain tiles. They should all be patterned, and it would be more like 'tiles' if they were half as thick. I guess the thickness is to make them easier to pick up. It's not to my taste, but it sure is causing a buzz at the moment!

Well I guess it's all how you look at it.

A tile only earns you points when it is freshly added, but the amount of points you gain will depend on previously laid tiles.

So if you add tiles in a vertical column on a round, first tile gets you one point, second tile earns you an additional 2 points and the third tile gets you three points, meaning you earnt 6 in total. In effect the first tile has contributed to your score three times, the second one twice and the third at the bottom of the column has contributed once.

So though you don't freshly evaluate points on previously laid tiles, they clearly are effecting the points you gain from a newly placed tile that was connected to it.

How is this incorrect? You place a tile and score it according to what is horizontally and vertically adjacent. The next time you place a tile, tiles that are already on your board will score again if they're horizontally or vertically adjacent to the tile you just placed.

I agree with you. That's why I was somewhat baffled.

Respuesta 7:
It is incorrect because a placed tile scores itself as part of EACH line. So for example, were it put in the middle of a cross of 5 tiles, it scores 6, not five. If you re-scored every adjacent tile, you would get inflationary scoring, as each adjacent tile would score 2 points for itself if it was part of both a horizontal or vertical line.

Semantically, in this case, it makes a big difference.

I ordered directly from Plan B and got my copy (North Carolina) yesterday. Played it three times already, and really love it. Yes, my gaming group all took notice of the little slot for the first player marker - AND that since there are 9 factory tiles, there are different depressions for them: one depression is one tile deeper than the other (hence, 4 tiles in the shallow depression and 5 in the deeper)! Well planned. Nice little touches that just add to one's appreciation of the game. The box cover is beautiful and the tile bag and rules cover as well. Of course, I love the resin tiles. (I also keep the tiles in the bag; but didn't get the joker tiles). I may have to order them, but wasn't sure how much they added to the game-play.

This is a game I will always be ready to play - and sets up quickly.

May seem silly but I decided to order another set of Joker tiles. My plan is that if there is a color blind person we can use them in the place of the red or blue tiles on the unmapped side of the board when playing.

They come 10 in a set. most normal colors come 20 to a set. When doing this it would just be another color without special rules.

My dad has some color blindness and I brought the red and blue tiles to see if he could tell the difference. I asked him to tell the difference and he gave me the exact colors they were, explaining that red and blue are pretty easy to tell apart.

The most common color blindness is red-green, meaning that these people have difficulty seeing the difference between mid-red and mid-green. Neither of the two main types of color blindness (red-green and blue-yellow) have difficulty with telling the difference between red and blue.

I have a good friend who is completely colorblind. His girlfriend pretty much put garanimals tags on his clothes (I don't know if anyone knows what that is any more). This one day he comes over in a neon lime green shirt, red pants, and flaming blue socks. I don't say anything, but I make a mental note to talk to his girlfriend about how the tags might be falling off stuff.

Before I can ask why his gf isn't there for games, he says, "XXXXX and I broke up and she moved out."

Le sigh. I need to figure out a nice way to go over and reorganize the tags.

I know people think Azul would have had a much nicer thing if all of the tiles had been patterned, but that's really expensive. Truthfully, their choices on that were really limited and I think they printed as many tiles as the budget would allow and picked good tiles to 'blank' for both people who are colorblind and the rest of us.

Tema 609: Advanced game: Tiles placed in a row with no valid wall columns left
Pregunta:
Hi, a question for the advanced variant:

I place tiles of a color in one of my pattern lines on my board. The corresponding row on my wall does not contain this color. However, once that pattern line becomes full and it is time to move a tile from it to the wall, there are no valid columns left on the wall to place the tile. What happens to the tiles on the pattern line?

Simple example:


    A   BCD..
   AA   CDE..
  ...   .....
 ....   .....
.....   ....A

I first move A into column #4 in the first row on the wall, leaving no valid positions for the A tile from row 2...

Any tiles you have picked that you cannot or do not want to place according to the rules, you must place in your floor line, filling its spaces from left to right.

Whether or not you can choose to have them clog up that placement row for the rest of the game is another question. I would think that eventually you'd want them cleared, and at that point you would put them into your floor row.

"They" or "It"?

Since in the OP's example you are already in the Wall-tiling phase, wouldn't it just be the rightmost tile that falls to the floor and all of the others on the complete pattern line discarded? This is really a crucial case and we ought to have an official clarification, but I think the way I describe what should happen makes the most logical sense.

I could see the way you are describing it possibly opens it up to abuse by taking tiles you have no intention of being able to place simply to have them not score you negative points because you had to take them.

Reverse the situation in the OP's post and have a single top tile fill in and then let the bottom row get discarded with only a 1 tile penalty instead of 5 tiles and I think that could lead to some abuse of the rules. We'll see what they say though.

Also the rules state, in the walling phase.

A) Go through your pattern lines from top to bottom. Move the rightmost tile of each complete line to the space of the same color in the corresponding line of
your wall. Each time you move a tile, score points immediately (see Scoring).
B) Then, remove all tiles from any pattern lines that now have no tile in the rightmost space. Place them into the lid of the game box to store them for now

You remove the excess after placing the wall tile into your grid, since you never placed the wall tile, you never get to part B.

If this is correct, and I'm not saying it's not, then that line would be locked for the rest of the game, correct? You can't move any tiles over and the only way to discard the excess is to move a tile into your pattern, so row 2 for the OP would be blocked from use for the rest of the game, correct?

Not exactly, because I think the rule about the Floor Line covers this in the variant, and those tiles you cannot place according to the rules would cause them to fall to the floor. We'll see what the official designer reply is though. That's how I'd play it without an official reply.

But the rule above is not for during the wall tiling phase, so it's not at all apparent that it would apply.

As I see it, as the rules currently stand the pattern line is now blocked for the rest of the game. You would have made a mistake by allowing this to happen (not thinking far enough ahead), so I don't think it's particularly unfair.

But I could see them adding a rule to say that as soon as that row is full you add the whole row to your floor if it's impossible to move a tile - which would seem a reasonable punishment for the mistake.

I don't think an FAQ is necessary - but I may create a living doc with the most common questions on it.

Anyhow, we have consulted with Mr. Kiesling and team - We've decided to create a special rule for this circumstance...

Special case: In the tile-laying phase, while moving a tile from a complete pattern line over to the wall, it is possible that there is not valid space left on the corresponding line on the wall for this tile. If this happens, this tile must be placed in the floor line .

In other words - Only the right most tile would be moved - because it's invalid, only that one would drop to the tile floor.

On the flip side, this could be a wasted turn of scoring (minimum 1 point, maximum 10 points) and potentially disrupts row and column filling end game bonuses (if the game ends in 5 rounds). That's another 2-9 points.

Azul rewards optimized drafting - this will have an impact on your score even if it's just a single tile that is dropped.

Okay, coming back to this a final time. We reviewed your thoughts and suggestions and decided to revise this again. This will be the final ruling - So much so that we've already put it into future editions of the rulebook.

So if the row is not fully filled and right-most tile is not to be placed, this rule does not apply? So, can I efficiently avoid negative points this way?



Tema 610: Unusual coincidence while learning about this game
Pregunta:
I had heard Azul mentioned a few times recently and saw that I was high on the hot lists so thought I should watch a video review to see what the game was about. I learned that it is about tiling a bathroom.

While watching the review I realised the coincidence that I currently at that very moment had a tiler in my bathroom putting in new tiles as part of our bathroom renovation. A picture below shows the finished works prior to the baths and sinks etc being put in. Not quite as bright as the tiles in Azul!

I wouldn't doubt Kiesling's ability to balance a game, but it seems self-evident that the first player on the first turn could easily have an advantage depending on the tile draw (e.g. if all four of the tiles on one of the coasters were the same color, you'd be silly not to take them). It does seem odd that there's no punishment for being the first player, but I suspect that the balancing mechanism is the threat of being the last player who needs to take tiles in a given round, which could potentially result in negative points if you can't assign them. Still, very unpredictable if this would happen... it's relatively likely that the last tile draft in a round could result in a point gain.

You get at least -1 point for claiming first on future round, so at least there's some consideration... even if in my plays I've generally found that -1 to be well worth taking in many circumstances.

Tema 612: Take No Tiles?
Pregunta:
Someone has to ask.

"On your turn, you must pick tiles in one of the following ways:
EITHER
a) Pick all tiles of the same color from any one Factory display

to the center of the table.
OR
b) Pick all tiles of the same color from the center of the table."

May I choose a color that is not represented in a factory, take all of them (no tiles), then move the remaining tiles to the center of the table?

I presume the designer did not intend to allow this play but I bet someone will ask me whether it is allowed. The rules can be read to allow it but I believe the intent is to require you to take one or more tiles on your turn (even though it uses the plural "you must pick tiles..."

Respuesta 2:
No you can't. Else it would defeat the whole purpose of having negative points for picking tiles you can't place.

I can't really see the rules being interpreted in that way.

If it said 'pick a colour, then take all tiles of that colour from one of the factory displays or the centre' then yes, you can choose a colour that has no tiles.

It specifically states 'on your turn you must pick tiles in one of the following ways...'. Picking no tiles is not picking tiles.

It would also just make it too easy to avoid negative points, so clearly not the designers intent.

As others have mentioned - no. There is no sidestepping as this could potentially create an endless loop of players refusing to draft tiles.



Tema 613: This game is very Moorish: you'll want to play it again and again
Pregunta:
This was one of the hit games of this year’s Essen Spiel, and justifiably so. There is a notional theme about King Manuel I decorating a Portuguese palace in Alhambra Moorish style, but this is unashamedly an abstract game.

In Azul, tiles are drawn randomly from a bag and four are placed on each of the ‘factory displays’ (small circular mats that look disconcertingly like cardboard beer mats: a point to beware if ever you are playing this game in a bar). Players take turns to select from any ‘factory’ or from the centre of the table any matching tiles, with the other tiles moved to the centre of the table. Whichever location the player chooses to take from, he must take all the tiles of that colour.

Tiles taken are placed on the ‘pattern line’ of the player’s board in horizontal rows. Each draw of tiles has to be placed in the same row; any that cannot be placed are ‘dropped’ to the floor and score negative points. When all the tiles in the ‘factories’ and in the centre of the table are gone, the round is scored. For each completed ‘pattern line’ row, the end tile is placed in the player’s ‘wall’. The remaining tiles are put in the box lid to replenish the supply when the bag of tiles is empty. Tiles in incomplete rows stay put into the next round.

It is the scoring that makes this a compelling game of tactics. Players score just one point for a single isolated tile in the wall but they score also score a point for each tile they are vertically or horizontally linked to: so a tile making a row of three will score 3 points. Scores can rack up when a tile is placed in a wall so that it scores ‘Scrabble-like’ for both a horizontal row and a vertical column. A 7-point bonus is scored for each completed column and a player will score a 10-point bonus for having a complete set of a single colour in a wall. A small 2-point bonus is awarded for a completed horizontal row, but this also heralds the end of the game.

On a first play, players will merely seek to nab tiles to complete their ‘pattern line’ rows without having too much regard for what tiles will end up where and when in their wall. On subsequent plays, players realise the subtlety of the scoring and will eschew seemingly attractive tile groupings in order to go for those that maximise their score. The game even offers scope for ‘take that’ tactics as players spy what remaining tiles are of greatest advantage to other players and which might even score them negative points if they end up being forced to take them.

Azul is a game that players will find ever more rewarding with every play. Yet because its rules are so simple and straightforward, it is a game that can be very quickly taught and learned. It neatly fills a niche as a game that functions both as a gateway game and a game that provides thoughtful challenge to very experienced games players.

The tiles in Azul are solid and give the game a satisfying look and feel: this is a visually striking game. Having seen the great-looking neoprene mats produced by Plan B for their other games, it feels mildly disappointing that the player boards and ‘factory displays’ in Azul are merely cardboard. Perhaps if this game is as successful as it deserves to be, Plan B will produce neoprene mats as an optional extra. In addition, it would have been useful to have a second tile bag to take the discarded tiles which are recycled partway through the game. I normally complain that ‘first player’ tokens are over-produced and often unnecessary. The first player token in Azul is integrated into play, so does have a significant role. That being the case, it’s a pity it’s just a cardboard square; it would have been better if it had been another plastic tile. Azul would also strongly benefit from improved scoring boards. At present, scoring is done by moving a cube along a track. If the table is jogged, players risk being left uncertain or arguing over what their scores were. This was the main criticism of the player boards in last year’s big hit game Terraforming Mars, so it’s especially unfortunate to see it repeated in Azul.

These are offered as hopefully helpful suggestions for improvements that I’d liked to see Plan B Games address in an ungrade or deluxe edition but they don’t seriously detract from what is nonetheless an exceptionally strong and appealing abstract game.

For a 360 view of Azul, take a look at my Board's Eye View review page on Facebook: www.facebook.com/boardseye.



Tema 614: Why not fill pattern lines from left to right?
Pregunta:
We've played 5 times so far, and one tiny problem I keep having is that during the Factory Offer Phase I end up so focusing on the right hand column of tiles, that when I get to the fourth or fifth row I sometimes go to move the right most tile only to then realize that the row wasn't complete, and have to move the tile back. I guess my vision gets so focused on that column, and I don't zoom out far enough to notice there's an empty spot at the far left

This lead me to wonder why we don't just fill pattern lines from left to right, just like we do for the Floor Line. This way, if there is a tile in the right most column, you know it's ready for moving, as it will only be there if the row is already full. I can then just hone in on the right hand column, as I've found myself doing anyway. It also makes the rules easier to state (rather than "move the rightmost tile for each complete line" it becomes "if there is a tile in the right most spot, move it.")

The only down side to doing it this way is that the rules ask you to move all your tiles first then go through and move any tiles remaining in rows that now have no tile in the right most spot. If you fill from the left, you won't be able to tell if a gap in the rightmost spot is because you haven't yet filled that row (in which case you need to leave the tiles where they are) or because you've moved a tile (in which case you need to remove the remaining tile.

But for me personally, this is easy to fix, because I actually have ended up doing the discard on a row by row basis, as I go, rather than waiting to the end of the phase. Meaning there's no confusion possible.

So if anyone else has ever found it a problem that we fill from right to left (leading to it not being so obvious when a row is incomplete, when your focus is on the right-most tiles), then play with the following rules:

1)In the Factory Offer phase, place tiles from left to right in your chosen pattern line.

2) In the Wall tiling phase go through your pattern lines from top to bottom. If there is a tile in the right-most column of a pattern line (thus meaning the line is full) first discard all the other tiles from that row (if there are any) to the lid of the game box. Then move the remaining tile to the space of the same colour in the corresponding line of your wall. Each time you move a tile, score points immediately.

None of this changes the game play at all, so I can't really see any downside to playing this way - but maybe I've missed something.

I totally get your point! I have a friend who thinks a bit differently than me. His spatial orientation is similar to yours. This is how he plays.

Tema 615: How to be playing Azul in just 10 minutes, without a copy.
Pregunta:
I didn't get to go to Essen, but I still taunted myself by reading all about the latest games. This morning, having watched another video, I decided the release I most wished I'd been able to purchase was Azul. Not only does it look beautiful but I really had an urge to have my brain occupied by the juicy decisions it presents.

About a minute later I realised this was just the sort of game that I could dummy up with pieces from other games, and a bit of a doodle on some paper to make player boards. Most of the games I enjoy require a tonne of specialised components (mainly cards) so it was almost a shock to realize this was one I could play today.

So while my husband made us both breakfast I looked at the rules in the BGG files section, raided my other games for bits and drew out two player boards. The lengthiest problem was working out which of our games had 20 identical shaped pieces in 5 different colours (I could do less pieces for 5 colours, or enough pieces in four colours, but 20x5 was tricky. I contemplated my son's lego, but didn't fancy having to sort out all those bits. In the end I realised Ticket to Ride trains worked (though not at all resembling ceramic tiles!) I drew a coloured dot on each of the squares on the player board in the 5 train colours. I also used one of the TTR discs as a first player marker, borrowed the draw bag from Roll for the Galaxy, and stole the score dials from Lord of the Rings the Card Game, and used our glass component bowls for the Factory Displays. So a real Frankenstein's monster of a game. I'm sure other people would find better replacements from their collections, but this would work.

Of course my improvised copy lacks all the charm of the real thing, but if the gameplay is good it should still be fun with an ugly copy... and it was. Our first play hit all the notes I'd hoped for, with so many things to weigh up. Just fantastic. So at least I can be playing now, rather than having to wait until it's available in the UK.

Here's what it looked like, just before our final Wall Tiling Phase (end scores were 64 to my husband, 60 for myself):

So while my husband made us both breakfast I looked at the rules in the BGG files section, raided my other games for bits and drew out two player boards. The lengthiest problem was working out which of our games had 20 identical shaped pieces in 5 different colours (I could do less pieces for 5 colours, or enough pieces in four colours, but 20x5 was tricky. I contemplated my son's lego, but didn't fancy having to sort out all those bits. In the end I realised Ticket to Ride trains worked (though not at all resembling ceramic tiles!) I drew a coloured dot on each of the squares on the player board in the 5 train colours. I also used one of the TTR discs as a first player marker, borrowed the draw bag from Roll for the Galaxy, and stole the score dials from Lord of the Rings the Card Game, and used our glass component bowls for the Factory Displays. So a real Frankenstein's monster of a game. I'm sure other people would find better replacements from their collections, but this would work.

I used the pieces from   that I picked up from the works for £10.



It even came with a bag for the pieces and some wooden discs to use as the score markers

Overall we found it to be a fairly enjoyable abstract, but nothing remarkable. It presented itself as a cross between Qwirkle (played with the restrictive placement of the trio board) and the limited take and place mechanics of Qwixx.

However, unlike those games the only reconisable interaction between the players is in the form of "hate drafting". This provides the game with a bitter taste in respect to the overall game play and focuses the majority of the decision making on tactical serendipity at the expense of longer term strategic planning.

I can see people appreciating the game as a lightweight abstract that doesn't demand much from its players, but its succeptability to nasty tactics (not unlike stock dumping in 18xx games) might be too much for some players.

All told I'm happy with my "make do and mend" Rondo version and the urge to rush out and buy an actual copy of Azul is very weak. I might develop the impetus to design and print off some nice player boards and a shared score board, but that is about as far as my own affection extends for the game.

A solid middle of the road game with some fairly nice melamene pieces (only three fifths of which are patterned) and some functional artwork on a few flimsy oversized boards.

The bag looks nice though.

6.5 out of 10. It would have been a 7 based on the game design, but for the relatively high price of £33 I expect thick player boards and a full compliment of "engraved" tiles replete with patterns.

Respuesta 15:
Was Rondo a recent The Works purchase? I've not seen that one on there.

I'm sorry you didn't find the game play of Azul that compelling. I felt there was so much more to think about than in Qwixx.

How to maximize our scores was enough to fill my head (last night my husband managed to pull off the ultimate placement of finishing off a row and column with one tile, and earning 10 points from that one tile during Wall Tiling (plus the further points at the end).

But if it doesn't do it for you, then it's good you didn't buy the real thing. I'm still hoping Santa will bring me a copy despite already accumulating 17 plays on my TTR copy.

Yup, Rondo was in their last group of games and they still had copies left up until a month or so ago. It was the last one of that influx to sell out.

https://www.theworks.co.uk/p/board-games/rondo/4001504881450

It falls into the same category as Azul, simple abstract filler. Quite a good buy with the 30% off and free postage I got.

Copies are floating around ebay for £14 to £18 and I'm fairly confident a few will show up at the UK Games Expo bring and buy next year - as the works offerings frequently do.

No need to feel sorry that we didn't like Azul. We just didn't find the pronounced "hate drafting" potential and the compartmentalised decision making to be very enjoyable, but I'm happy that you and many others are enjoying it.

It's just a simple matter of personal preference and I'm sure plenty of people out there will like it. That is one of the best things about our hobby. We are fortunte that games exist to meet every kind of pereference and the opinion of one person never makes a game good or bad, unless they are highlighting fundamental problems with the design or very poor component quality.

Azul suffers from neither of these things. It's a solid design with the easy breezy decision making that many gamers will welcome. It just didn't appeal to us or do anything that we havent seen before.

Although I do find the gushing enthusiasm for the melamine tiles to be a little perplexing.

They represent a nice component choice, but games like Hive and Codinca have used them before and they generated a much lesser buzz, even though the engraved pieces you get in Hive and some of the other games by John Yianni are higher quality and more expensive to manufacuture.

Plan B seem to have adopted a pricing strategy that targets the high point of what their game components could be expected to command, but the components in Azul and the previously released Century Spice Road only seem to be acceptable in my opinion. Like the average card quality in Century along with stock wooden cubes instead of custom shapes and flimsy boards and a half printed tile distribution in Azul.

I don't have any problem with premium pricing, but if a company charges premium prices then I expect premium quality components. And that equates to quality card stock, thick player boards that won't warp, tiles and dice that are engraved and not silk screen, heat transfer or pad printed and custom wooden pieces.

Tema 616: Winning conditions
Pregunta:
SO I played the game last night around 15 times, but it ends so quick, so basically the strategy seems to be making the most points possible in the beginning and trying to make a line to win and that's it. Or am I doing something wrong?

Also when you pick from the middle do you have to pick all of it or do you pick a certain colour but get the 1st player token with a -1?

By getting the first player token, don't you get to begin first on the next run?

1. It will take at least 5 rounds to complete a line. If that is your only strategy, I should be easy to steal a march on points by making good connections. It will also be easy to block you by taking the colour(s) you need.

Production row is the staging area before you tile your wall. They vary in length (1-5 spots) based on their row. The left side of the board is the production row.

Once a color/pattern is tiled on your wall, you can't place another of that same color in the same production row. Ex I placed a red in row one. I can't draft red again for row 1 - the spot is filled and the tile would instead be placed in the negative point section (the floor).

this is interesting, we always play with the rule that we still able to draft the red color tile in the row that the wall tile already contained red, just during wall tiling phase, all the red tiles in the production row will be throw off, it's like u wasted your turn during the wall tiling phase.

My opinion isn't worth much here, but I am an owner of Sagrada and have Azul on pre-order. I've watched a number of playthroughs of Azul, including Joel's.

I am a big fan of Joel's, however he has made a huge mistake in his play through. He's acknowledged the mistake on his BGG video. To get a better idea of gameplay, I would recommend JonGetsGames play through (until if/when Joel updates his video).

Clearly I'm biased - However, I have both and enjoy both a quite a bit. Azul is much more streamlined and elegant. Sagrada has a dash bit more in terms of rules (due to hidden information and ways to manipulate dice). I prefer Azul as a pure strategy game with open information and twist on the drafting mechanism. I'm nearly 60 games in in the last 5 weeks and still thoroughly enjoy it.

Respuesta 4:
Thanks for the insightful replies. I was aware of the mistakes in Joel's video and spotted them as they occured. I still got a good lookin of the gameplay and enjoyed the playthough. I'm not much of a fan of Jon Gets Games.

Azul seems to be pulling me in more so I've gone ahead and pre-ordered it. I want to hold those tiles!

Respuesta 5:
I played Sagrada three times over the spring/summer. I enjoyed my plays, but it was a rather unmemorable experience. I never felt that restricted in placing my dice. This game seems to have a lot more player interaction, especially at lower player counts, which is probably when it will be played the most. The tough choices combined with the beauty of the game made it an instant pre-order for me.

Respuesta 6:
Like others here, I own Sagrada and have pre-ordered Azul. Having watched Azul played numerous times via play-throughs on video, I can hardly wait for the game to arrive. I do like Sagrada, but I think I will love Azul. What are the similarities, and what the differences? Similarly: I think both fall into the 'puzzly' category. They are fairly short, are basically abstract, and both challenge the puzzling side of your mind (arranging, organizing). Further, I see both as attractive in persentation, with Azul grabbing a slight edge due to those amazing tiles. As for differences: Azul seems 'cleaner' with fewer rules. For example, the varying tools and various public goals in Sagrada vs. the simplicity of choosing tiles and properly assigning them in Azul. So, it seems the same depth of thought is required in Azul with less hoops to run through. I have always admired games that provide a strong depth-of-play to simplicity-of-rules ratio. And Azul seems to have it in spades.

This is not to say Sagrada is inferior. I think both games are exceptional. I just think Azul is a step ahead. I will gladly play both - and soon will own both.

Respuesta 9:
That it is not Mahjong. And offers greatest decision space and potential combos out of the three.

That it is not Mahjong.
Sebastian is correct. It is based on mahjong solitaire, which is a pair matching game most people know as Mahjong. It uses similar tiles, though.

EDIT: To answer the original question, I think Michael Young sums it up good. Azul is much more strategic and direct. You can block and plan, how ever you do not have the hidden information you have in sagrada, which often has been the difference between 1st and 2nd place in my games.

I think they both are too different to choose, so buy the cheepest first?

Thanks for the insightful replies. I was aware of the mistakes in Joel's video and spotted them as they occured. I still got a good lookin of the gameplay and enjoyed the playthough. I'm not much of a fan of Jon Gets Games.

Azul seems to be pulling me in more so I've gone ahead and pre-ordered it. I want to hold those tiles!
I own Sagrada and got to play Azul at PAX Unplugged this past weekend. My opinion, FWIW, is that if I had to choose one over the other, I would pick Azul over Sagrada. Sagrada has a lighter feel, where it's almost a puzzle game. Your decisions are fairly limited and your ability to understand your opponents choices is limited. Azul feels much more strategic in terms of interaction with other players; you can see what they're working towards and can block them or intentionally make life difficult, while at the same time you can vary your strategy on the fly in a much more effective way than Sagrada. In Sagrada, you often have to improvise on the fly and players start with varying difficulty.

I enjoy both games and will pick up Azul to go with Sagrada....but I think I prefer Azul.

You've just described the interaction in Sagrada, not in Azul, which was exactly my point.

In a lot of these games, the only effect on the other players of me taking something is that they can't have that thing (as in Sagrada). But in Azul, taking something also changes what is available to the other players. It's eminently possible to deliberately screw someone by forcing them to take something they really don't want.

That is literally saying the same thing but using different words :) Not sure what your intention here was. It's obvious that if you take something, then it's no longer available to other players. Just because you take things in chunks doesn't really change the mechanic and perception. Like I said, the fact that you've took plate with 2 red and 3 yellow, where I needed that 3 yellow, is not an interaction in my book, it's a side-effect. You play to maximize your own score, not to minimize the score of others.

Respuesta 19:
You've clearly misunderstood what I'm saying. The difference is that when you take something from one of the factory spaces in Azul, the other tiles on that space go into the middle. So you don't just take away one option, you also change the still remaining options. Since the round continues until every tile has been taken, this means you can, for example, create a large batch in the middle that someone else is forced to take. This can give them up to -14 points, in a game where a winning score might be in the 50s.

I absolutely played to minimise the score of others, even in a 4p game, and this would be stronger in 2-3p. If you just blindly take the thing that is best for you, it's very likely you'll end up being the one screwed with a batch of 7 tiles you can't place at the end of the round.

OK, fine, but -1 point is pretty much insignificant as a proportion of your overall score. In Azul you can be screwed for up to -14 (and the winning scores in the two games are in a similar range). That makes 'dick moves' much more powerful in Azul, not to mention that it's easier to spot the 'dick moves' as there are no hidden goals and the tiles have only one attribute not two.

I think you have to accept that all games have a repetitive nature and abstracts generally have a lower variability due to their nature of moves of pieces on a board.

The questions to me are: Is it fun? Is it something where you have to learn to be good at it? Is it something I can introduce to others I know?

If I can answer yes to these then it is worth having on my shelf.

Luckily, I apply a few other criteria otherwise I would have bought a lot more.

Despite some people’s upset at the cost of boardgames they are still great value when compared to other pastimes.

and a second bag (just like the one already included but perhaps with the print in orange?).

I'll be glad to clarify, because you have made some strong assumptions that are inaccurate.

We had 2 separate shipments going to different locations: Essen and Canada. Canada's shipments ran into a slight delay. Germany's didn't. We decided to let people know there was a delay. It absolutely has nothing to do with redirecting the games to Essen. That did not happen here.

We're still on track to ship next week (from what I was told yesterday). That product isn't coming from Essen (logistically it would be way too expensive to get it there to ship in a reasonable time frame).

Respuesta 2:
So glad to hear this explanation from Michael! I'm sure I've made wrong assumptions (jumped to conclusions) as well, but this should be a reminder to us all, that a) things are not always as they seem; and b) we shouldn't express an opinion until we have all the facts! Quick to listen; slow to speak!
And, BTW, I can't wait to get my hands on Azul! This is one of the few games i've fallen in love with before ever playing the game.

Respuesta 3:
Indeed, it was my assumption that they had a direct shipment to Essen as this is what most companies do to save costs.

Usually it is the shipment to Germany that gets held up which is rather distressing to publishers and designers whose sole purpose of attending is to sell those games and share their love for it.

Yes I am one of those guys who bough both versions of Century Spice Road. I just fell in love when I seen the Golem edition and had to have it too. Sprung for the play mat for that one.

I did appreciate the head up about the delay. I was just sad, because I am so very excited.

Agreed, the tactile feel is such a wonderful experience with this game. I'm over 50 games now, and I still love digging through the bag for tiles. Between the clickity noise and the really nice components, it's pure joy!

For me, it's the complete opposite. I've bought quite a few games after playing them on Yucata, BoardGameArena, or BoiteAJeux. Onirim and probably some others to, on iOS.

Of course, the exception to my rule is Through The Ages, which I can't see myself playing a physical copy ever again. The app takes care of all the bookkeeping, and the AI plays way faster than anyone I would care to play against.

Azul would make for an interesting challenge. I'd probably want to play it first before I tried to make a port.

Tema 629: Proposed Solo Mode
Pregunta:
I posted in another thread, but it seems to be buried there.

I’ve been thinking about a solo mode for Azul. The core interaction between players seems to be at the tile selection. Could a solo mode with 2 D6 simulate the other players tile selection?

1 D6 would indicate which factory to take the tiles from. The other would which colour to take. Since there are 5 colours and 5 factories in a 2 player game, the 6th spot on the colour die would be copy the solo players last selection. The 6th spot on the factory die would indicate the center. If there were no tiles of the same colour on the indicated factory, then the other player would move one factory clockwise until it was selected. If the colour isn’t there at all, you flip the die to opposite side.

You could then have win conditions for different levels that include total points and numbers of completed rows and columns.

The publisher is in Rigaud, QC, which makes it kind of annoying to have to wait. They ship from somewhere in Canada.

I pre-ordered Azul because I read such good reviews about the game, and knew it would be a popular choice game due to its interactivity and its puzzle solving nature. It is too bad the joker tiles are not included with the base version of the game.

Rules are available online at PlanBGames.com (I'll see to it that we get them uploaded here).

Anyhow, the Jokers provide some flexibility in drafting and placing...however, it's at a cost of not qualifying for some bonuses. It's a fun mini expansion to toss into the game with some experienced players to add another layer of strategy into your decision making.

I played 2 games with joker tiles and 2 without. I have the impression the joker tiles make it more forgiving/easier. On the other hand it makes it harder to obtain the +10 bonus for getting all 5 tiles of a color.

The group I played preferred not adding in the bonus tiles but I suspect it depends on the people you're playing with.

I can't answer that with 100% certainty. That being said, I put a call in to verify when shipments aren't meant to arrive at our distributor.

Furthermore, the free joker promo pre-order ended on October 1st. I'll follow up when I get word, but if you're plan on canceling for the free promo, the window has passed (you can still order them separately for $9 though). If you're ordering to save time, I'll let you know ASAP.

Chatting with GTS - they told me that the ship is due to dock next week - however customs can take a while before releasing them. Next it takes some time to travel to the warehouses and then to retailers.

So, in a nutshell, GTS and Plan B Games has never explicitly communicated November 1 as a release date because there is too much out of our control. Presumably your retailer took GTS's "November 2017" to assume November 1st, no biggie as many do. That being said, GTS is hoping for copies to be in retailers by Thanksgiving (late November). I've asked to be updated as things progress, especially if there are any delays. I'll do my best to keep BGG updated.

Tema 636: 2 copies= 8 players?
Pregunta:
Would 8 players be possible if we combined 2 copies of the game?

Respuesta 1:
I'm sure it would be. One thing that you would probably want to consider doing with 5+ players is to create 2 "circles" of the disks (called factories I think?). Just make the circles as close to the same size as possible.

On a player's turn, if they take all matching tiles from one disk, then they slide the remaining tiles into the center of the corresponding circle. Then, when players are taking the leftovers of one type from a center pool of tiles, they have 2 center pools to choose from (this helps prevent something like a dozen tiles of one type getting pawned off on one player). As for the 1st player marker, I would propose that only one is used, and whoever drafts from either central pool first takes the 1st player marker for the upcoming round.

It seems like it would be a really long 8-player game, but it might be okay with 5 or 6 players with my suggested modifications.

You mean this? "Azul releases on October 26, 2017 at the Essen Spiel game fair and will be available at friendly local game stores shortly after." I'm looking for the "shortly after" date...
I'm not sure for game stores, but the direct order from Plan B says, "This item is in pre-order and will be shipped October 15th 2017 to customers. Thank you very much for your patience."

Does Azul have a U.S. release date?
There are too many variables to pinpoint an exact date at this moment. That being said, I would assume comfortably before the winter holidays. As soon as I get details, I'll pass them along.

Those unable to wait, we plan on shipping copies from our warehouse in less than two weeks.

If you look at the post above yours, a representative of Plan B Games gave what is probably the best answer we can get at this point. If you're ordering from Funagain, the discount they're offering makes me nearly certain they are selling the domestically distributed version, not the one to be released at Essen. So November/December would be my guess based on the reply above.

They will send a tracking number when they ship your order, but I doubt they even know when they plan to ship you your game. It looks like if you're really eager to play, your best bet is to order direct from Plan B.

Thanks for answering. This game looks great. You guys should consider solo players in your games. The mechanics would lend well to playing solo with probably little to no additional components. I’m sure someone could figure out a great way to make it work. Why not make a contest for someone to figure it out and give the winner a free game?

I am a solo player as well! However, so much of this game is the tension in drafting. I suppose we could think of an algorithm for a bot/AI to draft with but there are no plans to do so at the moment.

I’ve thought a little about this. The core interaction between players seems to be at the tile selection. Could a solo mode with 2 D6 simulate the other players tile selection?

1 D6 would indicate which factory to take the tiles from. The other would which colour to take. Since there are 5 colours and 5 factories in a 2 player game, the 6th spot on the colour die would be copy the solo players last selection. The 6th spot on the factory die would indicate the center. If there were no tiles of the same colour on the indicated factory, then the other player would move one factory clockwise until it was selected. If the colour isn’t there at all, you flip the die to opposite side.

You could then have win conditions for different levels that include total points and numbers of completed rows and columns.

I am assuming the Joker tiles won't be available as currently they are pre-order only on your website and no pre-orders for Essen? This makes it sound like they may not last beyond Spiel and may not be reproduced.

I ask as I might be able to accept £10.50 for the jokers direct from you at Plan B but can't afford the free tiles with the game as the shipping + Customs + Royal Mail Holding charges are just too much to warrant.

However, I wouldn't want to pay £10.50 to then find I can get them in the UK after all for circa £7.

Your advice would be greatly appreciated.

Tema 640: Joker tiles avaiability
Pregunta:
Is this only available from Plan B's web store? Shipping just kills any kind of sale for this mini expansion as it costs more than the tiles itself. No chance for a retail or BGG store release? Shame as it adds a gameplay element and isnt something like the playmat in Century: Spice Road which is an aesthetic thing.

Respuesta 1:
You can get Azul and the expansion as a bundle for just the price of Azul from their webstore. That's a pretty fair deal I felt so I ordered.

In the end it's a promo, so it won't matter to the game much, but its a shame that it's a small gameplay change with a price tag of $20.

You can order the bonus tiles separately. I see the price as $9 with $3 shipping. So separately it's a $12 promo shipped. So support the O/FLGS of choice and pick up the tiles from us.

Tema 642: Azul review by Shorty's short reviews
Pregunta:
[ImageID=azul]

I recently got a chance to play a prerelease copy of Azul by plan B games, here are my thoughts on this game

WHAT IS AZUL:

Beautiful colored tiles lie in their factories ready for you to take and create your mosaic, but which ones do you take? Azul is an abstract tile laying and drafting game that relies on careful planing, astute observation of your opponents moves, and thinking several moves ahead.

During your turn, you draft all tiles of the same color from one of the factories on the table, the rest go into a common pool in the center of the table, that can also be drafted from. The first player to draft from this common pool will also get a point subtracted from their score however, they will get to go first on the next turn. Azul is easy to learn, fun to play with complex strategy and planing and a bit of luck thrown in.

WHO IS THE GAME FOR:

Strategy players.
Families.
Good game to teach novices.

QUALITY OF COMPONENTS:

As with their other offerings, PlanB has created another game with high guilty components. The beautifully made plastic tiles come in 5 vibrant colors that are visually appealing as well as having a fantastic tactile feel to them. Each tile is finished in a high gloss finish, giving them a ceramic glaze look and feel. The player boards are equally colorful and are made of a nice guilty cardboard finished in a gorgeous satin finish.

PROS

Great abstract game.
well made components.
Challenging and competitive.
High replayability.

CONS:

May take a game or two to pickup on how to draft tiles effectively.
Can be pron to Analysis paralysis.
Scoring tiles can be a bit confusing at first.

TIME: 30 to 40 minutes
NUMBER OF PLAYERS: 2-4
AGE 8+

DIFFICULTY:

Easy rules that can be learned quickly but has deep strategy that keeps you engaged.

FINAL THOUGHTS:

I love games with a minimalistic feel, great components and rules that a quick to learn and easy to remember and Azul has hit the trifecta with all three. This is a extremely fun and challenging game, that delights all the sense, visually appealing as well as tacitly pleasing, it engages you from the moment it hits the table. The rules are simple, you draft tiles from the factories, represented by round boards, in the center of the play area, each having 4 tiles. These tiles are then placed on your player board, but be careful, if you draft more tiles then spaces available on your board, those extra tiles become negative points against you.

There are 5 rows on your board for tiles and each row with a different number of slots to fill, starting with one and ending with 5. So careful planing is a must, and paying attention to your opponents moves will be critical for your future tile drafting. Once you have the appropriate number of tiles in your row, you can the move one of those tiles to the scoring side of the board, while the rest return to the tile pool.
These are the basic rules of the game, there are others, but I will let the reader discover those on their own.

Azul is a fun game, which engaged me the moment I started playing, It is a feast for the eyes and extremely challenging for the mind. Easy enough for beginners as well as children, but highly challenging for advanced players with its deep strategy. There is a certain element of luck to this game, mainly having to due with the tiles that are available on your turn, but even this luck factor can be overcome with advanced planning and careful strategy.

Game play is fast, however analysis paralysis is a possibility due to the nature of having to think several moves ahead. Also, there is an element of take that to the game, which is due to the tiles being left at the end of a round that exceed the next players available slots causing them to get a lot of negative points. So if your a player who likes to play cutthroat, you can leave your opponents in the dust.
Setup is fast allowing you to jump in to the game within minutes and the rules are quick and easy to teach.

Needless to say, we had fun playing Azul and I wanted to play this game again immediately when we finished, as I realized the mistakes I had made in our previous game and I wanted to try out an new strategy I had in mind. WARNING: this game is highly addictive.

I can not wait for this games release later this year and I will buy it to go in my collection.

Respuesta 1:
Sounds like another hit from Plan B Games!

Respuesta 2:
Does it bother OP or anyone else that players never complete the mosaic on their player board? It's very satisfying in a game like Sagrada when you complete the entire pattern on your player board. Just curious how that unfinished state would feel. Thanks!

Respuesta 3:
Hi Heath,

Good Question. Actually this did not bother us at all, as the mechanics of the game do not require you to complete your mosaic. You score points by having tiles next to each other. For instance, if you place a tile and complete a row, you score points for all the tiles in that row. You also score points of tiles touching each other.

So, completing the mosaic is not the objective, but completing rows and columns is.

Hope that helps

Tema 644: Plan B proudly announces Azul!
Pregunta:
Designed by the world famous, award winning game author Michael Kiesling, Azul captures the beautiful aesthetics of Moorish art in a contemporary board game. Players compete as artisans decorating the walls of the Royal Palace of Evora. By carefully drafting the correct quantity and style of tiles, the most clever of artisans plan ahead to maximize the beauty of their work (not to mention their scores!) while ensuring they wasted no supplies in the process.   



Introduced by the Moors, “azulejos” (originally white and blue ceramic tiles) were fully embraced by the Portuguese, when their King Manuel I, on a visit to the Alhambra palace in Southern Spain, was mesmerized by the stunning beauty of the Moorish decorative tiles. The king, awestruck by the interior beauty of the Alhambra, immediately ordered that his own palace in Portugal be decorated with similar wall tiles. 




Azul is suited for 2 – 4 artisans, ages 8+. While the actual decoration of the azulejos tiles took many years, we expect a game of Azul to last 30 – 40 minutes.


Azul releases on October 26, 2017 at the Essen Spiel game fair and will be available at friendly local game stores shortly after.  Pre-order before October 1st on Plan B Games webstore for an exclusive promo - Joker Tiles!

For those that don't want to have to fill out the entire form to find shipping costs, I was quoted about $12.50 to ship to Washington State. Given postage rates, that's not a surprising number. But I'd be lying if I said it didn't affect my willingness to pre-order all those pretty tiles on impulse.
We are shipping from Canada - and working with the best rates we can find
The problem with shipping to Europe is more that it will be caught in the toll and the fees are almost as high as the price for the game. In Denmark at least.

Question on this rule:

In the rare case that you run out of tiles again while there are
none left in the lid, start the new round as usual even though
not all Factory displays are properly filled.

Should we fill the Factory displays 1 tile at a time, or do we put 4 on a Factory tile before we move to the next? Let's say at the end in in a 4 player game I only have 30 tiles left, should this result in 7 Factory displays full and 1 with 2 and then the last with 0? Or should I end up with 6 with 3 tiles and the other 3 with 4 tiles?
